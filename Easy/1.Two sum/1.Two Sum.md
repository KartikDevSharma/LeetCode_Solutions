##  Two Sum

Given an array of integers ```nums``` and an integer ```target```, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have ```exactly one solution```, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

    Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
    Output: [0,1]
    Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

    Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
    Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

    Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
    Output: [0,1]
 

Constraints:

- ```2 <= nums.length <= 10^4```
- ```-109 <= nums[i] <= 10^9```
- ```-109 <= target <= 10^9```
- Only one valid answer exists.
 

Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than ```O(n^2)``` time complexity?

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers called `nums` and an integer called `target`, we need to find two numbers in the array that add up to the target value. We then need to return the indices (positions) of these two numbers in the array.

## Key Points to Understand

1. **Input**: 
   - An array of integers (`nums`)
   - A target sum (`target`)

2. **Output**: 
   - The indices of two numbers from the array that add up to the target

3. **Constraints and Assumptions**:
   - There is exactly one solution (one pair of numbers that sum to the target)
   - You cannot use the same element twice
   - The array length is between 2 and 10,000
   - The numbers in the array and the target can be positive, negative, or zero
   - The numbers can be quite large (up to 10^9) or small (down to -10^9)

4. **What the Problem is Asking**:
   - Search through the array
   - Find two different numbers that add up to the target
   - Remember or return the positions (indices) of these numbers in the array

## Examples Explained

1. **Example 1**: 
   - Array: [2, 7, 11, 15]
   - Target: 9
   - Solution: [0, 1]
   - Explanation: 2 + 7 = 9, and 2 is at index 0, 7 is at index 1

2. **Example 2**:
   - Array: [3, 2, 4]
   - Target: 6
   - Solution: [1, 2]
   - Explanation: 2 + 4 = 6, and 2 is at index 1, 4 is at index 2

3. **Example 3**:
   - Array: [3, 3]
   - Target: 6
   - Solution: [0, 1]
   - Explanation: 3 + 3 = 6, and the two 3's are at indices 0 and 1

## What You Need to Do

1. **Iterate through the array**: You need to check different combinations of numbers.

2. **Sum pairs of numbers**: For each pair of numbers you check, add them together.

3. **Compare with target**: See if the sum equals the target value.

4. **Track indices**: Remember the positions of the numbers in the array, not just the numbers themselves.

5. **Return the solution**: When you find a pair that sums to the target, return their indices.

6. **Handle no solution**: Although the problem states there will always be a solution, it's good practice to handle the case where no solution is found (return null or an appropriate indicator).

## Challenges to Consider

1. **Efficiency**: How can you solve this without checking every possible pair of numbers?

2. **Index tracking**: How do you keep track of the original indices when you're comparing numbers?

3. **Not using the same element twice**: How do you ensure you're not using the same array element for both numbers in the pair?

4. **Large numbers**: How do you handle potential overflow when adding very large numbers?

Remember, there are multiple ways to solve this problem, each with different trade-offs between simplicity, memory usage, and time efficiency. The solution provided in the problem statement is one approach, but there are others that might be more efficient or easier to understand.



# Intuition
The intuition behind this solution is to systematically check every possible pair of numbers in the array to find the two that add up to the given sum. It's a comprehensive brute force approach that guarantees finding the solution if it exists.

# Approach 1 Brute Force
The approach uses nested loops to compare all possible pairs of numbers in the array. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. We use two nested loops to iterate through the array.
2. The outer loop (`gap`) determines the distance between the two numbers we're comparing.
3. The inner loop (`right`) moves through the array, comparing the current number with another number that is `gap` positions behind it.
4. If we find a pair that adds up to the sum, we immediately return their indices.
5. If no solution is found after checking all pairs, we return an empty array.

Now, let's go through the code in detail:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findTwoSum(int[] numbers, int sum) {
        int length = numbers.length;
        
        for (int gap = 1; gap < length; gap++) {
            for (int right = gap; right < length; right++) {
                int left = right - gap;
                if (numbers[left] + numbers[right] == sum) {
                    return new int[] {left, right};
                }
            }
        }
        
        return new int[0]; // Return empty array if no solution found
    }
}
```

1. The outer loop starts with `gap = 1` and goes up to `length - 1`. This `gap` represents the distance between the two numbers we're comparing.

2. The inner loop starts with `right = gap` and goes up to `length - 1`. This `right` is the index of the second number in our pair.

3. We calculate `left = right - gap` to get the index of the first number in our pair.

4. Inside the inner loop, we check if `numbers[left] + numbers[right] == sum`. This is comparing the number at index `right` with the number that is `gap` positions before it.

5. If we find a pair that adds up to the sum, we immediately return their indices as an array: `{left, right}`.

6. If we complete both loops without finding a solution, we return an empty array.

# Dry Run Example

Let's do a dry run with a large array. This will help illustrate how the algorithm works through more iterations.

Let's use the following example:

```
numbers = [3, 2, 4, 1, 7, 9, 5]
sum = 12
```

Here's a detailed dry run:

| gap | right | left | numbers[right] | numbers[left] | sum | Return? |
|-----|-------|------|----------------|---------------|-----|---------|
| 1   | 1     | 0    | 2              | 3             | 5   | No      |
| 1   | 2     | 1    | 4              | 2             | 6   | No      |
| 1   | 3     | 2    | 1              | 4             | 5   | No      |
| 1   | 4     | 3    | 7              | 1             | 8   | No      |
| 1   | 5     | 4    | 9              | 7             | 16  | No      |
| 1   | 6     | 5    | 5              | 9             | 14  | No      |
| 2   | 2     | 0    | 4              | 3             | 7   | No      |
| 2   | 3     | 1    | 1              | 2             | 3   | No      |
| 2   | 4     | 2    | 7              | 4             | 11  | No      |
| 2   | 5     | 3    | 9              | 1             | 10  | No      |
| 2   | 6     | 4    | 5              | 7             | 12  | Yes [4,6] |
| 3   | 3     | 0    | 1              | 3             | 4   | No      |
| 3   | 4     | 1    | 7              | 2             | 9   | No      |
| 3   | 5     | 2    | 9              | 4             | 13  | No      |
| 3   | 6     | 3    | 5              | 1             | 6   | No      |
| 4   | 4     | 0    | 7              | 3             | 10  | No      |
| 4   | 5     | 1    | 9              | 2             | 11  | No      |
| 4   | 6     | 2    | 5              | 4             | 9   | No      |
| 5   | 5     | 0    | 9              | 3             | 12  | Yes [0,5] |

In this dry run:

1. The algorithm starts with `gap = 1` and checks all adjacent pairs.
2. It then increases the `gap` to 2, 3, and so on, checking pairs with increasing distances between them.
3. The first solution it finds is when `gap = 2`, `right = 6`, and `left = 4`. This corresponds to the pair (7, 5) at indices [4, 6], which sum to 12.
4. However, the algorithm doesn't stop here. It continues checking all possibilities.
5. It finds another solution when `gap = 5`, `right = 5`, and `left = 0`. This corresponds to the pair (3, 9) at indices [0, 5], which also sum to 12.

The algorithm would return [4, 6] as the solution, as this is the first pair it finds that sums to 12.

This larger example illustrates several important points:
1. The algorithm checks all possible pairs systematically.
2. It can find multiple solutions if they exist, but only returns the first one it encounters.
3. The number of iterations increases significantly with the size of the array, demonstrating the O(n^2) time complexity.
4. Despite the increased array size, the algorithm still uses only a constant amount of extra space (O(1) space complexity).

This comprehensive dry run helps to visualize how the algorithm works through a larger dataset, providing a clearer understanding of its operation and efficiency.


# Complexity

## Time complexity: O(n^2)

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. Let's break this down in detail:

1. Outer loop:
   - The outer loop starts with i = 1 and runs until i < nums.length.
   - This means it will execute n-1 times, where n is the length of the array.

2. Inner loop:
   - For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs from j = i to nums.length - 1.
   - In the first iteration of the outer loop (i = 1), the inner loop runs n-1 times.
   - In the second iteration (i = 2), it runs n-2 times.
   - This continues until the last iteration where it runs only once.

3. Total iterations:
   - The total number of iterations can be represented as:
     (n-1) + (n-2) + (n-3) + ... + 2 + 1
   - This is the sum of the first (n-1) natural numbers, which is equal to n(n-1)/2.

4. Big O notation:
   - The exact number of iterations is n(n-1)/2.
   - In Big O notation, we ignore constants and lower-order terms.
   - n(n-1)/2 simplifies to (n^2 - n)/2, which is O(n^2).

Therefore, the time complexity is O(n^2).

Implications of O(n^2) time complexity:
- For small arrays, this algorithm will be very fast.
- As the size of the array grows, the execution time will increase quadratically.
- For very large arrays (e.g., millions of elements), this algorithm may become impractically slow.

Best and Worst Cases:
- Best case: O(1) if the solution is found in the first iteration (when the first two elements sum to the target).
- Worst case: O(n^2) if the solution is at the end of the array or if no solution exists.

## Space complexity: O(1)

The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1), which means it uses constant extra space. Let's analyze this in detail:

1. Input space:
   - The input array `nums` and the `target` are not considered in space complexity analysis as they are part of the input.

2. Variables:
   - The algorithm uses a few integer variables (i, j) for loop counters.
   - These variables use a constant amount of space, regardless of the input size.

3. Output space:
   - The algorithm returns an array of two integers.
   - This output array always has a fixed size of 2, regardless of the input size.

4. No additional data structures:
   - The algorithm doesn't use any additional data structures like hash tables or temporary arrays.
   - It performs all operations in-place on the input array.

5. Recursive calls:
   - There are no recursive calls in this algorithm, so there's no additional space used on the call stack.

Implications of O(1) space complexity:
- The algorithm is very memory-efficient.
- It can handle very large input arrays without requiring additional memory.
- The memory usage remains constant regardless of the input size.

Comparison with other approaches:
- Some solutions to this problem might use a hash table for faster lookup, which would result in O(n) space complexity.
- This solution trades off time efficiency for space efficiency.

In summary, while this algorithm has a relatively high time complexity of O(n^2), it achieves an optimal space complexity of O(1). This makes it a good choice for scenarios where memory is a constraint, and the input size is not too large. However, for very large inputs, algorithms with better time complexity (even if they use more space) might be preferable.

# Approach 2:Two-pass Hash Table

## Intuition

The intuition behind this solution is to use a hash map to store the numbers we've seen so far and their indices. As we iterate through the array, for each number, we can check if its complement (target - current number) exists in the hash map. If it does, we've found our pair.

This approach allows us to solve the problem in a single pass through the array, trading space for time efficiency.

## Approach

1. Create a hash map to store numbers and their indices.
2. Iterate through the array once to populate the hash map.
3. Iterate through the array again:
   - For each number, calculate its complement (target - number).
   - Check if the complement exists in the hash map.
   - If it does and it's not the same index as the current number, return the pair of indices.
4. If no solution is found, return null.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. Here's why:

1. We iterate through the array once to populate the hash map: O(n)
2. We iterate through the array again to find the complement: O(n)
3. Hash map operations (put and get) are generally O(1) on average.

So, the total time complexity is O(n) + O(n) = O(2n), which simplifies to O(n).

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(n) because in the worst case, we might need to store all n elements in the hash map.

## Detailed Dry Run

Let's do a detailed dry run with the following example:

```java
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
```

We'll use a table to show the state of the hash map and the checks performed at each step.

### First Loop: Populating the Hash Map

| Iteration | i | nums[i] | Hash Map After Operation |
|-----------|---|---------|--------------------------|
| 1         | 0 | 2       | {2: 0}                   |
| 2         | 1 | 7       | {2: 0, 7: 1}             |
| 3         | 2 | 11      | {2: 0, 7: 1, 11: 2}      |
| 4         | 3 | 15      | {2: 0, 7: 1, 11: 2, 15: 3} |

### Second Loop: Checking for Complements

| Iteration | i | nums[i] | complement | map.containsKey(complement) | map.get(complement) != i | Result |
|-----------|---|---------|------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------|
| 1         | 0 | 2       | 7          | true                        | true                        | Found! Return [0, 1] |
| 2         | 1 | 7       | 2          | true                        | true                        | (Not reached) |
| 3         | 2 | 11      | -2         | false                       | N/A                         | (Not reached) |
| 4         | 3 | 15      | -6         | false                       | N/A                         | (Not reached) |

### Detailed Explanation of Each Step

1. First Loop:
   - We iterate through the array and populate the hash map with each number as the key and its index as the value.
   - This allows us to quickly look up if a number exists and get its index.

2. Second Loop:
   - For each number, we calculate its complement (target - nums[i]).
   - We check if the complement exists in the hash map.
   - If it does, we make sure it's not the same index as the current number (to avoid using the same element twice).
   - If both conditions are met, we've found our pair and return their indices.

3. In our example:
   - When i = 0, nums[0] = 2, we calculate the complement: 9 - 2 = 7
   - We check if 7 exists in the hash map (it does)
   - We check if the index of 7 is not the same as the current index (it isn't)
   - We've found our pair, so we return [0, 1]

4. The function returns after finding the first valid pair, so the loop doesn't continue after finding the solution.

This approach is efficient because we only need to go through the array twice at most, and each lookup in the hash map is O(1) on average. The trade-off is that we use extra space to store the hash map, but this allows us to achieve a linear time complexity.

# Approach 3: One-pass Hash Table

## Intuition

This solution improves upon the previous one by combining the two loops into a single pass through the array. The core idea remains the same: use a hash map to store complements and their indices, but now we're checking for the complement and updating the map in the same loop.

## Approach

1. Create an empty hash map to store numbers (as keys) and their indices (as values).
2. Iterate through the array once:
   - For each number, calculate its complement (target - current number).
   - Check if the complement exists in the hash map.
   - If it does, we've found our pair, so return the indices.
   - If not, add the current number and its index to the hash map.
3. If no solution is found after the loop, return null.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this optimized solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. Here's why:

1. We iterate through the array only once: O(n)
2. Hash map operations (put and get) are generally O(1) on average.

The total time complexity is O(n), which is the same as the previous solution, but with better average-case performance due to potentially finding the answer earlier.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity remains O(n) because in the worst case, we might need to store n-1 elements in the hash map before finding the solution.

## Detailed Dry Run

Let's do a detailed dry run with the following example:

```java
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
```

We'll use a table to show the state of the hash map and the checks performed at each step.

| Iteration | i | nums[i] | complement | map.containsKey(complement) | Action | Hash Map After Operation |
|-----------|---|---------|------------|-----------------------------|---------|-----------------------------|
| 1 | 0 | 2 | 7 | false | Add 2 to map | {2: 0} |
| 2 | 1 | 7 | 2 | true | Found solution | {2: 0} |
| 3 | 2 | 11 | -2 | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| 4 | 3 | 15 | -6 | N/A | N/A | N/A |

### Detailed Explanation of Each Step

1. First Iteration (i = 0):
   - Current number: nums[0] = 2
   - Calculate complement: 9 - 2 = 7
   - Check if 7 is in the map (it's not)
   - Add 2 to the map with index 0: map = {2: 0}

2. Second Iteration (i = 1):
   - Current number: nums[1] = 7
   - Calculate complement: 9 - 7 = 2
   - Check if 2 is in the map (it is!)
   - We've found our solution: [map.get(2), 1] = [0, 1]
   - Return this result and exit the function

3. The loop ends here as we've found our solution.

## Key Differences from the Previous Solution

1. Single Pass: This solution only requires one pass through the array, potentially finding the answer faster.

2. Early Return: As soon as we find a complement in the map, we return the result. We don't need to finish populating the entire map.

3. Map Updates: We only add a number to the map after we've checked for its complement. This ensures we don't use the same element twice.

4. Order of Return: The indices are returned as [complement's index, current index], which may be in a different order compared to the previous solution. This is still correct as the problem typically doesn't specify an order for the returned indices.

## Advantages

1. Efficiency: This solution is more efficient in the average case, as it may find the answer before reaching the end of the array.

2. Simplicity: The code is more concise and easier to understand, with only one loop to manage.

3. Memory Usage: In many cases, this solution will use less memory as it stops adding elements to the map once a solution is found.

This optimized approach maintains the O(n) time complexity of the 2nd approach while potentially improving real-world performance and slightly reducing memory usage in the average case.

class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        // In case there is no solution, we'll just return null
        return null;
    }
}
