So, what's really going on here? We've got a series of stock prices, one for each day, and we're trying to maximize our profit. But there's a twist – every time we make a trade, we have to pay a fee. It's like we're playing a game where we can buy and sell as often as we want, but each move costs us something. The challenge is figuring out when it's worth making a move and when it's better to sit tight.

At first glance, it might seem like we should just buy low and sell high, right? But it's not that simple. Sometimes, even if the price goes up, it might not go up enough to cover the fee. And other times, it might be worth holding onto a stock even if the price dips a little, because we expect it to go up more later.

Let's start with a naive approach. What if we just looked at each day and decided whether to buy or sell based on whether the price went up or down? We could buy whenever the price is lower than the next day and sell whenever it's higher. But wait a minute – that doesn't account for the fee at all. We'd be making tons of tiny trades, and the fees would eat up all our profit. Clearly, we need to be more strategic.

Okay, so maybe we could try to find the biggest ups and downs in the price chart? We could look for the lowest points to buy and the highest points to sell. But hold on – how do we know when we've hit the lowest or highest point? We can't see into the future. And even if we could, sometimes a small profit might be worth taking if the fee is low enough, rather than waiting for a bigger swing that might never come.

As we think about this more, a pattern starts to emerge. On any given day, we're really only in one of two states: either we're holding a stock, or we're not. And our goal is always the same – to have as much money as possible at the end. So instead of trying to predict the future, what if we just focused on making the best decision for today, based on what we know right now?

Let's break it down. If we're not holding a stock, we have two choices: stay put or buy. If we're holding a stock, we again have two choices: keep holding or sell. And here's the key insight – the best choice depends not just on today's price, but on how much money we could have in each state.

Think of it like this: imagine you have two bank accounts. One represents your money when you're not holding a stock (let's call it your "cash" account), and the other represents your money if you were holding a stock (let's call it your "hold" account). Every day, you get to decide whether to move money from one account to the other.

If you're in the "cash" state, you could stay there, or you could buy a stock. Buying means moving your money to the "hold" account, but you have to subtract today's stock price. If you're in the "hold" state, you could stay there, or you could sell. Selling means moving to the "cash" account, and you get to add today's stock price, but don't forget to subtract the fee!

Now, here's where it gets interesting. What if, instead of actually moving the money, we just kept track of how much we could have in each account if we made the best possible decisions up to that point? Then, each day, we're not really deciding whether to buy or sell – we're calculating the maximum possible value for each account based on the previous day's values and today's stock price.

This is the "aha" moment. We don't need to know the future or keep track of when we bought or sold. We just need to know, for each day, what's the most money we could have in each state. The beauty of this approach is that it naturally handles all the complexities of when to trade. If the potential profit from a trade isn't worth the fee, the maximum value won't change, which is equivalent to not making the trade.

As we start to formalize this idea, we can see that we need two variables: one for the maximum "cash" value and one for the maximum "hold" value. We'll update these every day based on the stock price. For the "cash" value, we take the maximum of staying in cash or selling our held stock. For the "hold" value, we take the maximum of keeping our held stock or buying a new one.

Mathematically, it looks like this:
cash = max(previous_cash, previous_hold + price - fee)
hold = max(previous_hold, previous_cash - price)

Notice how elegant this is – the fee only comes into play when we're selling (moving from hold to cash), which matches the problem description perfectly.

Now, you might be wondering about edge cases. What if the price stays flat? What if it only goes up or only goes down? The beautiful thing about this approach is that it handles all these cases automatically. If it's not worth trading, the maximum values won't change. If there's a clear best time to buy or sell, the values will reflect that.

As we implement this solution, we need to think about how to initialize our variables. Obviously, we start with zero cash. But what about the hold value? Well, if we're considering the value of holding a stock on the first day, that means we would have had to buy it, so our initial hold value should be negative the price of the first stock.

One last thing to consider: space complexity. Because we only need the previous day's values to calculate the current day's values, we don't need to store the entire history. We can just use two variables that we update as we go, giving us constant space complexity.

In the end, our cash variable will represent the maximum profit we could have made, because the optimal strategy will always end with selling any held stock (otherwise, we'd have left money on the table).

This approach simplifies such a complex problem. We're not trying to predict the future or make complex decisions. We're just consistently updating our potential best outcomes, and the optimal trading strategy emerges naturally from that process.

```Java []
public class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices, int fee) {
        if (prices == null || prices.length <= 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int cash = 0;
        int hold = -prices[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            cash = Math.max(cash, hold + prices[i] - fee);
            hold = Math.max(hold, cash - prices[i]);
        }
        
        return cash;
    }
}
//KDS
