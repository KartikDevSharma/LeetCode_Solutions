## Problem Statement
### 1. The Problem Setup:
   - You're given a binary tree. A binary tree is a tree-like structure where each node has at most two children (left and right).
   - The root of the tree is given to you. The root is the topmost node of the tree.
   - Each node in this tree has a unique value (no two nodes have the same value).
   - You're also given an array called `to_delete`. This array contains values of nodes that need to be deleted from the tree.

### 2. What You Need to Do:
   - Your task is to delete all the nodes whose values are in the `to_delete` array.
   - After deleting these nodes, the original tree might break into multiple smaller trees. This collection of smaller trees is called a forest.
   - You need to return a list of the root nodes of all these smaller trees.

### 3. Understanding the Process:
   - When you delete a node:
     - If it's a leaf node (no children), you simply remove it.
     - If it has children, those children become roots of new trees in the forest.
   - The nodes that aren't deleted and don't have a parent after deletions become roots of trees in the forest.

### 4. Examples Explained:

   Example 1:
   ```
   Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
   ```
   - The tree looks like this:
         1
       /   \
      2     3
     / \   / \
    4   5 6   7
   - You need to delete nodes with values 3 and 5.
   - After deletion:
     - Node 1 remains the root of a tree (with 2 and 4 as its descendants)
     - Node 6 becomes the root of a new tree
     - Node 7 becomes the root of another new tree
   - So the output is [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]

   Example 2:
   ```
   Input: root = [1,2,4,null,3], to_delete = [3]
   ```
   - The tree looks like this:
         1
       /   \
      2     4
       \
        3
   - You need to delete the node with value 3.
   - After deletion, only the original tree remains intact (just without node 3).
   - So the output is [[1,2,4]]

### 5. Constraints to Keep in Mind:
   - The tree won't have more than 1000 nodes.
   - Node values are between 1 and 1000.
   - The `to_delete` array won't have more than 1000 elements.

### 6. Approach to Solve:
   - You'll likely need to traverse the tree (e.g., using depth-first search).
   - As you traverse, you'll check if each node's value is in the `to_delete` array.
   - If a node needs to be deleted, you'll need to handle its children appropriately.
   - Keep track of the roots of new trees formed after deletions.

Remember, the order of the trees in your output doesn't matter. The important thing is to correctly identify and return all the root nodes of the trees in the resulting forest.



# Intuition and Approach: Depth-First Search (DFS) with Node Deletion

The approach used in this solution can be termed as "Depth-First Search (DFS) with Node Deletion". This method combines the power of DFS traversal with an efficient mechanism for node deletion and forest construction. Let's break down the intuition and approach in great detail:

## Intuition:

The core idea behind this solution is to traverse the entire binary tree once, making decisions about each node as we go. We need to determine which nodes to delete, which nodes become new roots in our forest, and how to handle the children of deleted nodes. 

A depth-first approach is intuitive here because:

1. It allows us to process each node exactly once.
2. We can make decisions about a node before processing its children, which is crucial for determining if those children will become new roots.
3. It naturally follows the tree structure, making it easier to reason about parent-child relationships.

The use of a boolean array for marking nodes to delete is a clever optimization. Since we know the range of node values (1 to 1000), we can use this array for O(1) lookups, which is faster than using a HashSet.

## Approach:

Let's dive deep into the approach, examining each part of the code:

1. Class Setup:
   ```java
   class Solution {
       private boolean[] toDelete = new boolean[1001];
       private List<TreeNode> forest = new ArrayList<>();
       // ...
   }
   ```
   - We initialize a boolean array `toDelete` of size 1001 (since node values range from 1 to 1000).
   - We also create a list `forest` to store the roots of our resulting trees.

2. Main Method:
   ```java
   public List<TreeNode> delNodes(TreeNode root, int[] to_delete) {
       for (int val : to_delete) {
           toDelete[val] = true;
       }
       
       dfs(root, true);
       
       return forest;
   }
   ```
   - We first mark all the nodes that need to be deleted by setting their corresponding indices in `toDelete` to true.
   - We then call our DFS method on the root, passing `true` to indicate that it's initially a root.
   - Finally, we return our forest of remaining trees.

3. DFS Method:
   ```java
   private TreeNode dfs(TreeNode node, boolean isRoot) {
       if (node == null) {
           return null;
       }
       
       boolean shouldDelete = toDelete[node.val];
       
       if (isRoot && !shouldDelete) {
           forest.add(node);
       }
       
       node.left = dfs(node.left, shouldDelete);
       node.right = dfs(node.right, shouldDelete);
       
       return shouldDelete ? null : node;
   }
   ```
   This is the heart of our solution. Let's break it down further:

   a. Base case:
      ```java
      if (node == null) {
          return null;
      }
      ```
      If we reach a null node, we simply return null. This handles leaf nodes and empty subtrees.

   b. Deletion check:
      ```java
      boolean shouldDelete = toDelete[node.val];
      ```
      We check if the current node should be deleted by looking up its value in our `toDelete` array.

   c. Forest construction:
      ```java
      if (isRoot && !shouldDelete) {
          forest.add(node);
      }
      ```
      If the current node is a root (either the original root or a child of a deleted node) and it's not marked for deletion, we add it to our forest.

   d. Recursive calls:
      ```java
      node.left = dfs(node.left, shouldDelete);
      node.right = dfs(node.right, shouldDelete);
      ```
      We recursively process the left and right children. Note that we pass `shouldDelete` as the `isRoot` parameter for the children. This is because if the current node is deleted, its children will become new roots.

   e. Return value:
      ```java
      return shouldDelete ? null : node;
      ```
      If the current node should be deleted, we return null (effectively removing it from the tree). Otherwise, we return the node itself.

This approach elegantly handles all the requirements of the problem:
- It deletes nodes by returning null when `shouldDelete` is true.
- It constructs the forest by adding nodes to `forest` when they're roots and not deleted.
- It maintains the tree structure for non-deleted nodes.
- It turns children of deleted nodes into new roots by passing `shouldDelete` as the `isRoot` parameter in recursive calls.

# Complexity

## Time Complexity: O(N)

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. Initialization of `toDelete` array:
   - This takes O(D) time, where D is the length of the `to_delete` array.
   - Since D ≤ N (we can't delete more nodes than exist), this step is O(N) in the worst case.

2. DFS traversal:
   - The DFS method visits each node in the tree exactly once.
   - For each node, we perform constant time operations:
     - Checking if the node is null: O(1)
     - Checking if the node should be deleted: O(1) (array lookup)
     - Possibly adding the node to the forest: O(1) (amortized time for ArrayList add)
     - Making recursive calls: O(1) (not counting the time within the recursive calls)
   - Since we visit each node once and perform constant time operations at each node, the overall time for DFS is O(N).

3. Returning the result:
   - This is a simple return of the `forest` list, which is O(1).

Combining all these steps, we get:
O(N) + O(N) + O(1) = O(N)

It's worth noting that while we have two O(N) terms, we don't add them to get O(2N) because in Big O notation, we drop constant factors.

## Space Complexity: O(N)

The space complexity is also O(N). Here's why:

1. `toDelete` array:
   - This is a boolean array of size 1001, which is O(1) space as it's a constant size regardless of the input.

2. `forest` list:
   - In the worst case, if no nodes are deleted, this could contain all N nodes of the tree.
   - Therefore, this could take up to O(N) space.

3. Recursion stack:
   - The depth of the recursion is equal to the height of the tree.
   - In the worst case (a completely unbalanced tree), this could be O(N).
   - In a balanced tree, this would be O(log N), but we consider the worst case for Big O notation.

4. Input storage:
   - We need to store the input tree, which takes O(N) space.
   - The `to_delete` array takes O(D) space, where D ≤ N.

Taking the maximum of these space requirements:
max(O(1), O(N), O(N), O(N)) = O(N)

It's important to note that while we have multiple O(N) terms, in Big O notation we're concerned with the order of growth, not the exact amount of memory used. Therefore, we express the overall space complexity as O(N).

This space complexity is essentially optimal for this problem, as we need to be able to represent the entire input tree and potentially return all nodes in the worst case.

## Dry Run Example
For dry run of the algorithm using a sample binary tree. Let's use the following example:

```
Input: 
root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
to_delete = [3,5]
```

This tree looks like:

```
     1
   /   \
  2     3
 / \   / \
4   5 6   7
```

Here's a detailed dry run in:

| Step | Action | Node | isRoot | shouldDelete | forest | Left Child | Right Child | Return Value |
|------|--------|------|--------|--------------|--------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | Initialize | - | - | - | [] | - | - | - |
| 2 | Mark to_delete | - | - | - | [] | - | - | - |
| 3 | Call dfs(1, true) | 1 | true | false | [1] | - | - | - |
| 4 | dfs(2, false) | 2 | false | false | [1] | - | - | - |
| 5 | dfs(4, false) | 4 | false | false | [1] | null | null | 4 |
| 6 | dfs(5, false) | 5 | false | true | [1] | null | null | null |
| 7 | Return to 2 | 2 | false | false | [1] | 4 | null | 2 |
| 8 | dfs(3, false) | 3 | false | true | [1] | - | - | - |
| 9 | dfs(6, true) | 6 | true | false | [1,6] | null | null | 6 |
| 10 | dfs(7, true) | 7 | true | false | [1,6,7] | null | null | 7 |
| 11 | Return to 3 | 3 | false | true | [1,6,7] | 6 | 7 | null |
| 12 | Return to 1 | 1 | true | false | [1,6,7] | 2 | null | 1 |
| 13 | Final Result | - | - | - | [1,6,7] | - | - | - |

Explanation of what's happening behind the scenes:

1. We start by initializing an empty forest.
2. We mark nodes 3 and 5 for deletion in the `toDelete` array.
3. We begin DFS with the root node 1. It's not to be deleted, so we add it to the forest.
4. We move to node 2. It's not a root and not to be deleted, so we don't add it to the forest.
5. We process node 4. It's a leaf node, not to be deleted, so we return it as is.
6. We process node 5. It's to be deleted, so we return null, effectively removing it from the tree.
7. We return to node 2, updating its left child to 4 and right child to null (since 5 was deleted).
8. We move to node 3. It's to be deleted, but we process its children first.
9. We process node 6. Because its parent (3) will be deleted, it's treated as a root and added to the forest.
10. Similarly, we process node 7, adding it to the forest as a new root.
11. We return to node 3, which is deleted (return null).
12. Finally, we return to the root (1). Its left child is 2, and its right child is now null (since 3 was deleted).
13. The algorithm completes, and we return the forest containing nodes 1, 6, and 7 as roots of separate trees.

This dry run illustrates how the algorithm:
- Traverses the tree in a depth-first manner
- Handles deletion of nodes
- Creates new roots for the forest when necessary
- Maintains the structure of non-deleted subtrees

The final result `[1,6,7]` represents three trees:
- A tree rooted at 1 with 2 and 4 as descendants
- A single-node tree with 6
- A single-node tree with 7

This matches the expected output `[[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]` from the problem statement.
