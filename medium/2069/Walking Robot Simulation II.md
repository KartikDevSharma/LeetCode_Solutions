### Intuition
The problem presents us with a grid-based world where a robot must move and turn according to specific rules. Simply put, this is a problem of spatial reasoning and pattern recognition.

To begin, we need to understand what the question is really asking. We're dealing with a rectangular grid where the robot starts in the bottom-left corner, facing east. The robot can move forward and turn left when it hits a boundary. Our task is to track its position and orientation after a series of movements.

The constraints given are improtant. The grid size is limited (2 <= width, height <= 100), which means we're not dealing with an infinitely large space. The number of steps per move can be quite large (up to 10^5), and we might have to handle up to 10^4 calls to our methods. These constraints hint that a naive simulation approach might not be efficient enough.

As we start to think about solutions, a few key observations come to mind:

>1. The robot's movement forms a predictable pattern around the perimeter of the grid.
>2. After a certain number of steps, the robot's position and direction will repeat.
>3. The total perimeter of the grid is a crucial value in understanding the robot's behavior.

Initially, we might consider a straightforward simulation approach. We could maintain the robot's current position and direction, updating them step-by-step as we process each movement instruction. This would work, but it would be inefficient for large numbers of steps. We'd essentially be recreating the entire path of the robot, even when we only care about its final position.

But we don't need to simulate every single step. Instead, we can think about the robot's movement in terms of cycles around the perimeter of the grid.

Picture the robot's path: it moves east along the bottom edge, then north up the right edge, west across the top edge, and finally south down the left edge before starting over. This forms a rectangle that exactly matches the perimeter of our grid.

Now, let's consider what happens when we ask the robot to take a large number of steps. It might complete several full cycles around the grid, plus some partial distance into the next cycle. This observation is important because it means we can break down any number of steps into:
>1. Complete cycles around the perimeter
>2. Remaining steps into the next incomplete cycle

This insight allows us to make a significant optimization. Instead of simulating every step, we can use modular arithmetic to immediately calculate the robot's position after any number of steps.

Let's define the perimeter of the grid as P = 2 * (width + height - 2). This represents one complete cycle of the robot's movement. For any given number of steps S, we can calculate:
- Complete cycles: S / P (integer division)
- Remaining steps: S % P

The complete cycles don't affect the robot's final position (it ends up where it started), so we can ignore them. We only need to consider the remaining steps to determine the robot's final location and orientation.

This realization transforms our problem from a step-by-step simulation into a mathematical calculation. We're no longer tracking the robot's movement, but instead computing its final state directly.

Now, let's think about how we can determine the robot's position and direction based on these remaining steps. We can divide the perimeter into four segments, corresponding to each edge of the grid:
>1. Bottom edge (moving east): 0 to width - 1 steps
>2. Right edge (moving north): width to width + height - 2 steps
>3. Top edge (moving west): width + height - 1 to 2 * width + height - 3 steps
>4. Left edge (moving south): 2 * width + height - 2 to P - 1 steps

By comparing our remaining steps to these ranges, we can immediately determine which edge the robot is on and calculate its exact position.

This approach solves our efficiency problem. No matter how many steps the robot takes, we can compute its final state in constant time. We've transformed a potentially O(n) operation (where n is the number of steps) into an O(1) operation.

We need to consider some edge cases:
1. What if the robot completes exactly one full cycle?
2. How do we handle the initial state when no steps have been taken?

These edge cases require careful handling in our implementation. For instance, if the robot completes exactly one full cycle, it will be at (0, 0) facing south, not east as it was initially.

If you think, you might realize that we can further simplify our logic by treating the initial state (0 steps) as a special case. This allows us to handle all other cases, including complete cycles, with the same logic.
In terms of implementation, we realize that we only need to store the total number of steps taken. Everything else can be calculated on demand. This leads to a very memory-efficient solution, using only a few variables regardless of the grid size or number of steps taken.
### Approach 
We'll break down the solution step-by-step:

1. Class Structure and State Management

Our Robot class needs to maintain the state of the robot and provide methods for movement and querying. The key state variables we need are:

- width: The width of the grid
- height: The height of the grid
- steps: The total number of steps taken by the robot

Pseudo-code for the class structure:

```
class Robot:
    private width, height: integers
    private steps: long integer

    constructor(width, height):
        this.width = width
        this.height = height
        this.steps = 0

    method step(num):
        // Implementation to be discussed

    method getPos():
        // Implementation to be discussed

    method getDir():
        // Implementation to be discussed
```

Notice that we're using a long integer for steps. This is crucial because the problem states that we can have up to 10^4 calls to step(), each with up to 10^5 steps. This means we could potentially need to track up to 10^9 steps, which exceeds the range of a 32-bit integer.

2. The Step Method

The step method is deceptively simple:

```
method step(num):
    steps += num
```

This simplicity is key to our solution's efficiency. Instead of simulating each individual step, we're simply keeping a count of the total steps taken. This approach allows us to handle large numbers of steps without performance degradation.

The real complexity of our solution lies in how we interpret this step count in the getPos() and getDir() methods.

3. Understanding the Robot's Path

Before we implement getPos() and getDir(), we need to understand the pattern of the robot's movement:

- The robot moves in a clockwise direction around the perimeter of the grid.
- One complete circuit around the grid covers 2 * (width + height - 2) cells.
- We can break this circuit into four segments, one for each side of the grid.

This understanding leads us to a key insight: we can use modular arithmetic to determine the robot's position and direction after any number of steps.

4. The getPos Method

The getPos method needs to return the current (x, y) coordinates of the robot. Here's how we can implement it:

```
method getPos():
    perimeter = 2 * (width + height - 2)
    effectiveSteps = steps % perimeter

    if effectiveSteps == 0 and steps != 0:
        return [0, 0]

    if effectiveSteps < width:
        return [effectiveSteps, 0]
    effectiveSteps -= width - 1

    if effectiveSteps < height:
        return [width - 1, effectiveSteps]
    effectiveSteps -= height - 1

    if effectiveSteps < width:
        return [width - 1 - effectiveSteps, height - 1]
    effectiveSteps -= width - 1

    return [0, height - 1 - effectiveSteps]
```

Let's break this down:

1. We calculate the perimeter of the grid. This represents one complete circuit of the robot's path.

2. We use modular arithmetic (steps % perimeter) to determine how many steps into the current circuit the robot is. This is our effectiveSteps.

3. We have a special case check for when the robot has completed one or more full circuits. In this case, it will be at (0, 0), but facing South instead of East.

4. We then check which segment of the path the robot is on:
   - If effectiveSteps < width, it's on the bottom edge moving right.
   - If it's past that but effectiveSteps < width + height - 1, it's on the right edge moving up.
   - If it's past that but effectiveSteps < 2 * width + height - 2, it's on the top edge moving left.
   - Otherwise, it's on the left edge moving down.

5. For each case, we calculate the x and y coordinates accordingly.

This approach allows us to determine the robot's position in constant time, regardless of the number of steps taken.

5. The getDir Method

The getDir method needs to return the current direction the robot is facing. We can implement it like this:

```
method getDir():
    if steps == 0:
        return "East"

    perimeter = 2 * (width + height - 2)
    effectiveSteps = steps % perimeter

    if effectiveSteps == 0:
        return "South"
    if effectiveSteps < width:
        return "East"
    if effectiveSteps < width + height - 1:
        return "North"
    if effectiveSteps < 2 * width + height - 2:
        return "West"
    return "South"
```

The logic here is similar to getPos:

1. We have a special case for the initial state (0 steps), where the robot is facing East.

2. We again calculate the effective steps into the current circuit.

3. We have another special case for when the robot has completed a full circuit, where it will be facing South.

4. We then determine the direction based on which segment of the path the robot is on, similar to the logic in getPos.

This method also runs in constant time, regardless of the number of steps taken.

6. Optimizations and Considerations

Our solution includes several important optimizations:

a) Constant-time operations: Both getPos and getDir operate in O(1) time, regardless of the number of steps taken. This is crucial for meeting the performance requirements of the problem.

b) Minimal state: We only store the total number of steps, width, and height. We don't need to maintain the current position or direction, as these can be calculated on demand.

c) Handling of large step counts: By using modular arithmetic, we can handle very large step counts without overflow issues.

d) Special case handling: We carefully handle edge cases, such as the initial state and completing full circuits.

7. Alternative Approaches

Before arriving at this solution, we might have considered other approaches:

a) Direct simulation: We could have maintained the current position and direction, updating them with each step. This would be simple to implement but would be O(n) in the number of steps, making it too slow for large step counts.

b) Storing position and direction: We could have updated and stored the current position and direction with each step call. This would make getPos and getDir trivial, but would require more complex logic in the step method and use more memory.

c) Using enums or integers for directions: Instead of string directions, we could have used enums or integer constants. This might have simplified some logic but would require conversion to strings in getDir.

Our chosen approach balances efficiency, simplicity, and adherence to the problem requirements.

8. Conclusion

This solution demonstrates several important problem-solving techniques:

1. Identifying patterns: Recognizing the cyclical nature of the robot's movement was key to developing an efficient solution.

2. Using mathematical insights: Leveraging modular arithmetic allowed us to handle large step counts efficiently.

3. Minimizing state: By storing only the essential information (total steps) and deriving other data as needed, we created a memory-efficient solution.

4. Handling edge cases: Carefully considering and handling special cases (like the initial state and completed circuits) ensures our solution is robust.

5. Optimizing for performance: By using constant-time operations, we ensure our solution can handle the maximum number of calls specified in the problem constraints.

This approach transforms what initially seems like a complex movement simulation into a series of straightforward calculations, showcasing the power of mathematical thinking in algorithm design.

### Complexity


**Time Complexity (TC): $O(1)$**

1. Constructor - Robot(int width, int height):
   TC: O(1)
   The constructor simply initializes three variables (width, height, and steps), which are all constant time operations.

2. step(int num):
   TC: O(1)
   This method performs a single addition operation, regardless of the input size. It's a constant time operation.

3. getPos():
   TC: O(1)
   Although this method has several conditional statements and arithmetic operations, the number of operations doesn't depend on the input size or the number of steps taken. All operations (modulo, addition, subtraction, comparisons) are constant time. The method will always execute in the same amount of time, regardless of the grid size or number of steps taken.

4. getDir():
   TC: O(1)
   Similar to getPos(), this method uses constant time operations (modulo, comparisons) and always executes the same number of operations regardless of input size or number of steps.

Overall Time Complexity:
- For a single operation: O(1)
- For n operations: O(n), where n is the number of method calls (not the number of steps)

The crucial point here is that even if we call step() with a very large number, the operation itself is still O(1). The time complexity doesn't depend on the number of steps, but on the number of method calls.

**Space Complexity (SC): $O(1)$**

1. Instance variables:
   SC: O(1)
   The class uses three instance variables (width, height, steps), which occupy a constant amount of memory regardless of the input size or number of operations.

2. Constructor - Robot(int width, int height):
   SC: O(1)
   No additional space is allocated beyond the instance variables.

3. step(int num):
   SC: O(1)
   This method doesn't allocate any new space, it only modifies an existing variable.

4. getPos():
   SC: O(1)
   This method creates a single integer array of size 2 to return the position. This is a constant amount of space regardless of input size or number of steps.

5. getDir():
   SC: O(1)
   This method returns a string reference, which doesn't depend on the input size or number of steps.

Overall Space Complexity: O(1)

The space usage remains constant regardless of the number of operations performed or the size of the inputs (within the given constraints).

Let's combine the strengths of both proofs and create a more detailed, comprehensive, and beginner-friendly mathematical proof for the robot navigation problem. This proof will not only provide a solid foundation for understanding the problem but also ensure clarity and thoroughness.

### Mathematical Justification
**Problem Statement Recap:**

We have a robot on a grid of dimensions `width x height` (denoted as `W x H`), starting at the bottom-left corner $0, 0$ and initially facing "East". The robot can move forward a given number of steps, and if it encounters the boundary of the grid, it turns 90 degrees counterclockwise and continues moving.

We need to determine the robot's position and direction after a given number of steps.

### Key Concepts and Notations

1. **Grid Dimensions:**  
   Let the grid have a width `W` and a height `H`. The grid has `W` columns and `H` rows, and the robot can move around the perimeter of this grid.

2. **Perimeter Calculation:**
   The perimeter `P` is the total number of steps the robot can take to complete one full circuit around the grid, returning to the starting point $0, 0$ and facing the same direction.
   $ P = 2W + 2H - 4
   \]
   - **Explanation:**  
     - The robot moves `W` steps along the bottom edge.
     - Then, `H-1` steps up along the right edge (excluding the top-right corner).
     - Next, `W-1` steps along the top edge (excluding the top-left corner).
     - Finally, `H-1` steps down along the left edge (excluding the bottom-left corner).

### Lemma 1: Cyclic Behavior of the Robot's Movement

**Statement:**  
The robot's movement is cyclic, meaning it repeats after every `P` steps.

**Proof of Lemma 1:**
- As the robot moves along the grid's perimeter, it covers exactly `P` steps before returning to the starting point $0, 0$ facing "East".
- After `P` steps, any additional steps will simply repeat the same path. Thus, after `P` steps, the robot's position and direction reset, forming a cycle.

**Conclusion:**  
Since the movement is cyclic, we can use modulo arithmetic to determine the robot's effective position and direction after any number of steps.

### Lemma 2: Effective Steps Using Modular Arithmetic

**Statement:**  
For any number of steps `S`, the remainder `e = S % P` gives the effective steps the robot takes within the current circuit.

**Proof of Lemma 2:**
- Suppose the robot takes `S` steps. We can express `S` as:
  $S = qP + e$
  where `q` is the number of complete circuits, and `e` is the remainder when `S` is divided by `P`.
- The remainder `e` represents the number of steps into the current cycle, so:
  $e = S \mod P$
- This remainder `e` is the effective number of steps that determines the robot's position within the current circuit.

**Conclusion:**  
Instead of simulating all `S` steps, we only need to consider `e` steps, which reduces the problem to calculating the robot's position and direction after `e` steps.

### Position and Direction Calculation

Now, let's break down the robot's movement along the grid's perimeter into four segments:

1. **Bottom Edge (Eastward Movement):**
   - **Range:** `0 ≤ e < W`
   - **Position:** The robot is on the bottom edge, moving rightward.
   - **Coordinates:** $e, 0$
   - **Direction:** "East"

2. **Right Edge (Northward Movement):**
   - **Range:** `W ≤ e < W + H - 1`
   - **Position:** The robot is on the right edge, moving upward.
   - **Coordinates:** $W-1, e - (W-1)$
   - **Direction:** "North"

3. **Top Edge (Westward Movement):**
   - **Range:** `W + H - 1 ≤ e < 2W + H - 2`
   - **Position:** The robot is on the top edge, moving leftward.
   - **Coordinates:** $W-1 - (e - (W + H - 2)), H-1$
   - **Direction:** "West"

4. **Left Edge (Southward Movement):**
   - **Range:** `2W + H - 2 ≤ e < P`
   - **Position:** The robot is on the left edge, moving downward.
   - **Coordinates:** $0, H-1 - (e - (2W + H - 3))$
   - **Direction:** "South"

### Theorem: Position and Direction Can Be Calculated in Constant Time $O(1)$

**Statement:**  
Both the robot's position and direction can be determined in constant time $O(1)$ using the effective steps `e`.

**Proof:**
1. **Calculate `e = S % P`:**  
   - This is a single modulo operation, which takes constant time $O(1)$.

2. **Determine the Segment and Position:**
   - Based on the value of `e`, we perform a constant number of comparisons (at most 4) to determine the robot's segment on the grid.
   - We then calculate the exact position within that segment using simple arithmetic operations, all of which take constant time.

3. **Determine the Direction:**
   - Similar to the position, we determine the direction by checking which segment the robot is in. This involves a few comparisons and returns the corresponding direction in constant time.

**Conclusion:**  
Since all operations—calculating `e`, determining the segment, and computing the position and direction—are performed in constant time, the overall complexity is $O(1)$. This makes the solution efficient even for very large inputs.

### Correctness of the Solution

**Verification:**
- The robot's cyclic behavior ensures that after every `P` steps, it returns to the starting point $0, 0$ and resets its direction to "East".
- Our calculations correctly handle edge cases:
  - **Initial State (`S = 0`):**  
    - The robot is at $0, 0$ facing "East".
  - **Complete Circuits (`S % P = 0`, `S ≠ 0`):**  
    - The robot is at $0, 0$ but faces "South", indicating it completed a full loop.

### Conclusion

This comprehensive proof demonstrates that:
1. The robot's movement is cyclic, with a cycle length equal to the grid's perimeter `P`.
2. We can efficiently compute the robot's position and direction after any number of steps using modular arithmetic.
3. The solution operates in constant time $O(1)$, ensuring both correctness and efficiency even for large inputs.
