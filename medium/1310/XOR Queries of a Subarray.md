### Intuition

We’re given an array of integers It’s a list of positive numbers, and we’re asked to solve several queries on it. Each query gives us two indices: a starting point and an ending point and we’re supposed to compute the XOR of the elements between those indices. If you’ve never worked with XOR before, think of it as a special kind of operation that compares numbers at the bit level, flipping bits where the numbers differ. 

For each query, we need to find the XOR of the elements between the two given indices. So for example, if the query says, “What’s the XOR of the elements from index 2 to index 5?” you’ll go to the array, look at the elements at those indices, and XOR them together to get the result.

The challenge here is that XORing can get tricky, and when we’re dealing with potentially thousands of queries, recalculating the XOR for every query from scratch would be inefficient. Our goal is to find a smarter way to get the answers without repeating unnecessary work.

When I first looked at the problem I thought about computing the XOR for every query one by one We can do this by looping through the subarray between the two indices of the query and XORing the numbers as we go might sound simple but if the array is large say with thousands of numbers, and you have a large number of queries, this approach will become slow very quickly. Every time you process a query, you’re doing a separate calculation, and if the queries overlap, you end up repeating a lot of work think about the scale We could have up to 30,000 queries on an array of up to 30,000 elements. That's a lot of potential operations. If we did it the brute-force way, we might end up doing the same XOR calculations over and over again for overlapping segments. That doesn't sit right with me - there's got to be a more efficient way.*

One important thing about XOR is that it has some really neat properties. For example, if you XOR a number with itself, it cancels out leaving you with zero. And if you XOR a number with zero it stays the same. These properties are going to be really helpful because they allow us to simplify certain computations. Let's think about the properties of XOR for a second. We already know that XOR is associative and commutative meaning the order doesn't matter. also A XOR A = 0, and A XOR 0 = A. 

Now think what if we could somehow precompute some of these XOR operations Like, what if we had a way to quickly get the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to any given index.
Imagine we had an array that stored the cumulative XOR up to each index. So the first element would just be the first element of the original array, the second would be the first XOR'd with the second, the third would be that result XOR'd with the third element of the original array, and so on. I'm starting to see a pattern here. If we had this cumulative XOR array, couldn't we use it to quickly compute the XOR of any segment? Let's think about how that would work. Say we want the XOR of elements from index 2 to index 5. If we had the cumulative XOR up to index 5, that would include everything from the start to index 5. But we don't want everything from the start - we only want from index 2. So... what if we XOR'd the cumulative result up to index 5 with the cumulative result up to index 1 Because XOR is its own inverse operation, XORing with the cumulative result up to index 1 would effectively "cancel out" all the XOR operations before index 2, leaving us with exactly what we want! So we could precompute this cumulative XOR array once, and then use it to answer any query in constant time. That would be a huge improvement over recalculating everything for each query.

Let’s say we want the XOR of a subarray that starts at index `left` and ends at index `right`. If we’ve already calculated the XOR of the entire array up to `right`, and we’ve also calculated the XOR up to `left - 1`, we can get the XOR from `left` to `right` by removing the part of the array before `left`. In other words, the XOR from `left` to `right` is simply:

$XOR$ from left to right = $XOR$ up to right , ${XOR}$ , $XOR$ up to left - 1

This observation is important because it tells us that we can compute the XOR of any subarray if we know the XOR of the prefix (i.e., the XOR of all elements up to a certain point in the array).



So, here’s what we can do:

1. **Precompute the XOR values for prefixes:** We go through the array once and compute the XOR of all elements from the start up to each index. This will give us a quick reference for any subarray we might need later. For example, if we have an array `[1, 3, 4, 8]`, we would build a prefix XOR array where each element at index `i` gives us the XOR of all elements from index `0` to `i`.

2. **Use the prefix XOR array to answer queries:** Once we have this array, each query can be answered in constant time. For a query asking for the XOR from `left` to `right`, we just XOR the prefix XOR values at `right` and `left - 1`. If `left` is `0`, then we simply return the prefix XOR at `right` since it covers the entire range.

This approach ensures that we don’t have to repeatedly calculate the XOR for overlapping parts of the array. We’re essentially storing all the intermediate results in the prefix XOR array, which saves us a lot of time.


But do we really need a separate array for this We're already modifying the values as we go along, so what if we just stored the cumulative XOR directly in the input array? That would save us some space let's take a step back and think about potential issues. Are there any edge cases we need to worry about or What about queries that start at index 0 Or queries that cover the entire array, For queries starting at index 0, we wouldn't need to do any "cancelling out"  we could just return the cumulative XOR up to the end index directly. And for queries covering the whole array, it would be the same - just return the last element of our modified array.

Okay, I think we've got the makings of a solid approach here. Let's walk through it step by step:

1.  We start by modifying our input array in place. Each element will now represent the cumulative XOR of all elements up to and including that index.
2.  To do this, we iterate through the array once. For each element (except the first), we XOR it with the previous element. This gives us our cumulative XOR array.
3.  Now, when we get a query for the XOR of elements from index 'start' to index 'end', we can use our modified array to compute it quickly.
4.  If 'start' is greater than 0, we XOR the element at index 'end' with the element at index 'start - 1'. This effectively cancels out all the XOR operations before 'start', leaving us with the XOR of elements from 'start' to 'end'.
5.  If 'start' is 0, we just return the element at index 'end', since it already represents the cumulative XOR from 0 to 'end'.

we're only iterating through the array once to set it up, and then each query can be answered in constant time. We're also not using any extra space beyond the input array, which is nice.

But let's think about it a bit more. Are there any assumptions we're making that might not hold? Well, we're assuming that the input array isn't empty, but the problem statement says it will have at least one element, so we're good there.

We're also assuming that all the queries are valid - that the 'end' index is always greater than or equal to the 'start' index, and that both are within the bounds of the array. But again, the problem statement guarantees this, so we don't need to add any extra checks.

Let's talk about how we are using the properties of XOR in a clever way. We're using the fact that XOR is its own inverse to "undo" operations we don't want, which is pretty neat. It's a good reminder that understanding the mathematical properties of the operations we're working with can often lead to elegant solutions.
This solution does modify the input array. In some contexts, that might not be allowed or might have unintended consequences. If we needed to preserve the original array, we could use a separate array for the cumulative XOR values, at the cost of some extra space.

So Instead of creating a separate prefix XOR array, why not just modify the original array in place? This way, we can store the XOR values directly in the array itself, avoiding the need for extra space. It’s a minor optimization, but it can help reduce memory usage, especially for very large arrays and for each element in the array, starting from the second one, we replace it with the XOR of itself and the previous element. This transforms the array into a prefix XOR array without needing additional memory.


Let’s walk through the thought process of how we’d implement this.

1. **Initialize the prefix XOR in-place:** We start by modifying the array. For each element from index `1` onwards, we replace it with the XOR of itself and the element before it. This gives us the cumulative XOR up to that point.

2. **Process the queries:** Now, for each query, we can quickly compute the result. If the query starts at index `0`, the XOR value is simply the value at the end index in the modified array (since it already holds the XOR of all elements up to that point). If the query starts at some other index, we can XOR the value at the end index with the value just before the start index. This effectively cancels out the part of the array that we don’t need.

Let’s take an example to make it clearer.

Suppose we have the array `[1, 3, 4, 8]` and the queries `[[0, 1], [1, 2], [0, 3], [3, 3]]`. 

- First, we modify the array into a prefix XOR array:
  - Start with `[1, 3, 4, 8]`.
  - The second element becomes `1 XOR 3 = 2`, so the array becomes `[1, 2, 4, 8]`.
  - The third element becomes `2 XOR 4 = 6`, so the array becomes `[1, 2, 6, 8]`.
  - The fourth element becomes `6 XOR 8 = 14`, so the array becomes `[1, 2, 6, 14]`.

Now, when we process the queries:
- For the query `[0, 1]`, the answer is simply the value at index `1` in the modified array, which is `2`.
- For the query `[1, 2]`, the answer is `6 XOR 1 = 7`.
- For the query `[0, 3]`, the answer is the value at index `3`, which is `14`.
- For the query `[3, 3]`, the answer is the value at index `3`, which is `8`.

i.e [2,7,14,8]



To summarize the important thing was recognizing that recalculating the XOR for every query would involve a lot of redundant work. By using the properties of XOR and precomputing the XOR values for the array in advance, we can answer each query in constant time, even if the array is large or there are many queries. 

It’s all about spotting the patterns—once we realized that the XOR of a range could be derived from the XOR of the prefixes, everything fell into place. 
You might visualize this solution to make it clearer. Imagine a number line where each point represents an element in our array. As we move along the line, we're accumulating XOR operations. When we want to query a specific segment, we're essentially asking for the difference between two points on this line - but instead of subtraction, we're using XOR to "undo" the operations we don't want.

Think of how this solution scales. As the array gets larger, our preprocessing step takes longer, but it's still just linear time. And no matter how large the array gets, each query is still answered in constant time. That's a really nice property - it means that once we've done our initial work, we can handle any number of queries very efficiently.

### Implementation
We are given an array of integers and several queries, each consisting of two indices `[left, right]`. For each query, we are asked to compute the XOR of the elements from index `left` to index `right`. The goal is to find an efficient way to compute the XOR for these queries, especially when the array is large, and the number of queries is also large.

  

### XOR Basics

  

XOR (Exclusive OR) is a bitwise operation that works on individual bits. When applied to two bits:

- `0 XOR 0 = 0`

- `1 XOR 1 = 0`

- `0 XOR 1 = 1`

- `1 XOR 0 = 1`

  

Some important properties of XOR that we'll use in  this problem are:

1. **XOR is associative and commutative:** This means the order of operations does not matter. For example:

- `(a XOR b) XOR c = a XOR (b XOR c)`

- `a XOR b = b XOR a`

2. **XOR with the same number cancels out:** For any integer `x`, `x XOR x = 0`.

  

3. **XOR with 0 returns the original number:** `x XOR 0 = x`.

  



  



  

We are using the **prefix XOR** technique, which allows us to compute the XOR of any subarray in constant time after an initial preprocessing step. The key insight is that the XOR of any subarray can be derived from the XOR of the array's prefixes.

  

#### 1. **Prefix XOR Concept**

  

We define the prefix XOR up to index `i` as the XOR of all elements from index `0` to index `i`. Let’s denote this as `prefixXOR[i]`.

  

Mathematically:

$prefixXOR[i] = arr[0] \, XOR \, arr[1] \, XOR \, \dots \, XOR \, arr[i]$

  

Now, the XOR of any subarray from `left` to `right` can be derived using the following formula:

$XOR(left, right) = prefixXOR[right] \, XOR \, prefixXOR[left - 1]$

This works because XOR is its own inverse. When we XOR the entire prefix up to `right` with the prefix up to `left - 1`, the part of the prefix before `left` cancels out, leaving only the XOR from `left` to `right`.

  

#### 2. **Special Case: When `left = 0`**

  

When `left = 0`, the prefix XOR up to `left - 1` does not exist. In this  case, the XOR of the subarray from `0` to `right` is simply `prefixXOR[right]`.

  

### Steps to Solve the Problem

  

1. **Precompute Prefix XOR Array:**

- Traverse the array once and compute the prefix XOR for  each index.

- Store the result in the same array or a separate array to save space and optimize memory usage.

  

2. **Answer Queries in Constant Time:**

- For each query, if `left > 0`, compute the XOR as `prefixXOR[right] XOR prefixXOR[left - 1]`. If `left = 0`, return `prefixXOR[right]` directly.

  


  



  



  

#### 1. **Precompute the Prefix XOR Array**

  

```pseudo

function precomputePrefixXOR(arr):

n = length(arr)

for i = 1 to n-1:

arr[i] = arr[i] XOR arr[i-1]

```

  

- Here, we modify the original array `arr` in place. Starting from the second element (index `1`), we XOR each element with the previous one to calculate the cumulative XOR up to that index.

  

#### 2. **Answering Queries**

  

```pseudo

function queryXOR(arr, left, right):

if left == 0:

return arr[right]

else:

return arr[right] XOR arr[left-1]

```

  

- For each query, we check if `left` is `0`. If it is, we directly return the cumulative XOR up to `right`. Otherwise, we XOR the cumulative XOR up to `right` with the cumulative XOR up to `left-1` to cancel out the unnecessary portion and get the desired subarray XOR.

  



  

Let’s walk through the entire process using an example.

  

#### Example

  

Consider the array:

```

arr = [1, 3, 4, 8]

```

  

And the queries:

```

queries = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [0, 3], [3, 3]]

```

  

#### Step 1: Precompute the Prefix XOR

  

We iterate over the array and compute the prefix XOR:

  

1. Initially: `arr = [1, 3, 4, 8]`

2. Compute XOR at index 1:

$arr[1] = arr[1] XOR arr[0] = 3 XOR 1 = 2$

Now, `arr = [1, 2, 4, 8]`

3. Compute XOR at index 2:

$arr[2] = arr[2] XOR arr[1] = 4 XOR 2 = 6$

Now, `arr = [1, 2, 6, 8]`

4. Compute XOR at index 3:

$arr[3] = arr[3] XOR arr[2] = 8 XOR 6 = 14$

Now, `arr = [1, 2, 6, 14]`

  

#### Step 2: Answer Queries

  

Now that we have the prefix XOR array, we can answer each query in constant time:

  

1. **Query [0, 1]**: Since `left = 0`, we directly return `arr[1] = 2`.

  

2. **Query [1, 2]**: We compute:

$arr[2] XOR arr[0] = 6 XOR 1 = 7$

  

3. **Query [0, 3]**: Since `left = 0`, we directly return `arr[3] = 14`.

  

4. **Query [3, 3]**: We compute:

$arr[3] XOR arr[2] = 14 XOR 6 = 8$

  

Thus, the results for the queries are:

```

[2, 7, 14, 8]

```

  


  

This approach uses the **associative and inverse properties of XOR** to avoid recalculating the XOR for overlapping subarrays. By precomputing the prefix XOR values, we can "cancel out" the parts of the array that don't contribute to the final result.

  

- **Precomputing the Prefix XOR:** This is done in linear time, i.e., `O(n)`, by iterating over the array once and calculating the cumulative XOR up to each index.

  

- **Answering Queries in Constant Time:** Once we have the prefix XOR values, we can answer each query in constant time, i.e., `O(1)`, by simply applying the XOR between the appropriate indices.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity

#### Preprocessing Phase
- The algorithm first modifies the input array to create a prefix XOR array.
- This involves a single pass through the array, performing an XOR operation for each element (except the first).
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array.

#### Query Processing Phase
- For each query, the algorithm performs at most one XOR operation.
- This operation takes constant time, O(1), regardless of the size of the array.
- With m queries, the total time for processing queries is O(m).

#### Overall Time Complexity
- Total time complexity: O(n + m)
  - O(n) for preprocessing
  - O(m) for processing m queries

#### Space Complexity

#### Additional Space Usage
- The algorithm modifies the input array in-place for preprocessing.
- It creates a new array `result` to store query results.
- Space for `result`: O(m), where m is the number of queries.

#### Overall Space Complexity
- O(m) additional space

### Proof and Intuitive Formulation of Efficient Range XOR Calculation

To solve the problem of calculating the XOR of elements over any subarray efficiently, we employ the following concepts. We'll explore why this approach works, delving into the key properties of XOR, the mechanics of the solution, and its correctness through detailed proofs.

#### 1. **Fundamental XOR Properties**

The XOR operation, denoted as `⊕`, follows several useful algebraic properties that make it ideal for tasks like range queries:

   - **Associativity**: $(A ⊕ B) ⊕ C = A ⊕ (B ⊕ C)$  
     This allows us to group terms freely in any sequence.
     
   - **Commutativity**: $A ⊕ B = B ⊕ A$  
     The order of terms doesn't matter, making rearrangements possible.
     
   - **Identity**: $A ⊕ 0 = A$  
     XORing any value with 0 leaves it unchanged.
     
   - **Self-inverse**: $A ⊕ A = 0$  
     XORing a number with itself cancels it out, resulting in zero.

#### 2. **Prefix XOR Array**

The core idea of the solution is to build a **prefix XOR array**. This is an auxiliary array where each element represents the XOR of all elements in the original array from the start up to the current index. Let's denote this prefix XOR array as $P[]$, and for any index $i$:

$P[i] = arr[0] ⊕ arr[1] ⊕ ... ⊕ arr[i]$

This array can be constructed in a single pass through the original array:

- $P[0] = arr[0]$
- $P[i] = P[i-1] ⊕ arr[i]$ for $i > 0$

The advantage of the prefix XOR array is that it allows us to compute the XOR for any subarray in constant time.

#### 3. **Resolving XOR Queries**

The task is to compute the XOR of elements between any two indices $L$ and $R$ in the array:

$Q[L, R] = arr[L] ⊕ arr[L+1] ⊕ ... ⊕ arr[R]$

Using the prefix XOR array, we can express this as:

$Q[L, R] = P[R] ⊕ P[L-1] \quad \text{(if $L > 0$)}$
$Q[L, R] = P[R] \quad \text{(if $L = 0$)}$

#### 4. **Proof of Correctness**

Let’s break down why the formula $Q[L, R] = P[R] ⊕ P[L-1]$ yields the correct result:

##### For $L > 0$:

We know that $P[R]$ represents the XOR of all elements from index 0 to $R$, and $P[L-1]$ represents the XOR of all elements from index 0 to $L-1$:

$P[R] = arr[0] ⊕ arr[1] ⊕ ... ⊕ arr[L-1] ⊕ arr[L] ⊕ ... ⊕ arr[R]$
$P[L-1] = arr[0] ⊕ arr[1] ⊕ ... ⊕ arr[L-1]$

Now, XORing $P[R]$ with $P[L-1]$:

$P[R] ⊕ P[L-1] = (arr[0] ⊕ arr[1] ⊕ ... ⊕ arr[L-1] ⊕ arr[L] ⊕ ... ⊕ arr[R]) ⊕ (arr[0] ⊕ arr[1] ⊕ ... ⊕ arr[L-1])$

By the **commutative** and **associative** properties of XOR, we can rearrange terms:

$= (arr[0] ⊕ ... ⊕ arr[L-1]) ⊕ (arr[0] ⊕ ... ⊕ arr[L-1]) ⊕ (arr[L] ⊕ ... ⊕ arr[R])$

Applying the **self-inverse** property $A ⊕ A = 0$:

$= 0 ⊕ (arr[L] ⊕ arr[L+1] ⊕ ... ⊕ arr[R])$
$= arr[L] ⊕ arr[L+1] ⊕ ... ⊕ arr[R]$

Thus, we successfully retrieve the XOR of the subarray $[L, R]$.

##### For $L = 0$:

When $L = 0$, we simply use $P[R]$, which is the XOR of all elements from 0 to $R$. This directly gives us the desired result:

$Q[0, R] = P[R] = arr[0] ⊕ arr[1] ⊕ ... ⊕ arr[R]$

#### 5. **Intuitive Understanding of the XOR Operation**

Think of XOR as a **toggle** operation. XORing a bit with 1 flips it, while XORing with 0 leaves it unchanged. The prefix XOR array $P[]$ captures the **cumulative toggle state** up to each index. When we XOR $P[R]$ with $P[L-1]$, we're essentially **undoing** all the toggles that occurred before index $L$, leaving only the toggles that happened between $L$ and $R$.

This can be visualized as:

```
Original array:    [  a0 | a1 | a2 | a3 | a4 | a5 | a6 ]
                         L               R

P[R]:              [ a0 ⊕ a1 ⊕ a2 ⊕ a3 ⊕ a4 ⊕ a5 ]
P[L-1]:            [ a0 ⊕ a1 ⊕ a2 ]
P[R] ⊕ P[L-1]:               [ a3 ⊕ a4 ⊕ a5 ]

```

In this visualization:
- The **full segment** from 0 to $R$ is represented by $P[R]$.
- The **left segment** from 0 to $L-1$ is represented by $P[L-1]$.
- XORing $P[R]$ with $P[L-1]$ cancels out the common part (i.e., from 0 to $L-1$), leaving us with the XOR for the segment $[L, R]$.

This "cancellation" effect is the key behind the efficiency of this method.

#### 6. **Handling Edge Cases**

- **Empty Array Visualization**: In cases where $L = R + 1$ (i.e., the range is effectively empty), the XOR of an empty set is conventionally 0. The formula still holds since both $P[R]$ and $P[L-1]$ will be the same, yielding:

$Q[L, R] = P[R] ⊕ P[L-1] = P[R] ⊕ P[R] = 0$

- **Single Element Ranges**: For queries where $L = R$, the XOR is simply the value at index $L$, as $P[R] ⊕ P[L-1] = arr[L]$.

#### 7. **In-Place Modification**

In practice, you may modify the original array to store the prefix XOR values directly. This works because:

- After the array is modified to store the prefix XOR values, no further changes are made to the array. We only use it for querying.
- Each element $arr[i]$ now contains $P[i]$, which is sufficient for resolving any query.

#### 8. **Time Complexity**

- **Precomputation** of the prefix XOR array takes $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the array.
- **Answering a query** takes $O(1)$, as we only perform a constant number of operations (XORs).
- Thus, for $q$ queries, the total time complexity is $O(n + q)$, which is a significant improvement over the naive $O(n \times q)$ approach.
