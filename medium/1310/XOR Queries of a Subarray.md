### Intuition

We’re given an array of integers It’s a list of positive numbers, and we’re asked to solve several queries on it. Each query gives us two indices: a starting point and an ending point and we’re supposed to compute the XOR of the elements between those indices. If you’ve never worked with XOR before, think of it as a special kind of operation that compares numbers at the bit level, flipping bits where the numbers differ. 

For each query, we need to find the XOR of the elements between the two given indices. So for example, if the query says, “What’s the XOR of the elements from index 2 to index 5?” you’ll go to the array, look at the elements at those indices, and XOR them together to get the result.

The challenge here is that XORing can get tricky, and when we’re dealing with potentially thousands of queries, recalculating the XOR for every query from scratch would be inefficient. Our goal is to find a smarter way to get the answers without repeating unnecessary work.

When I first looked at the problem I thought about computing the XOR for every query one by one We can do this by looping through the subarray between the two indices of the query and XORing the numbers as we go might sound simple but if the array is large say with thousands of numbers, and you have a large number of queries, this approach will become slow very quickly. Every time you process a query, you’re doing a separate calculation, and if the queries overlap, you end up repeating a lot of work think about the scale We could have up to 30,000 queries on an array of up to 30,000 elements. That's a lot of potential operations. If we did it the brute-force way, we might end up doing the same XOR calculations over and over again for overlapping segments. That doesn't sit right with me - there's got to be a more efficient way.*

One important thing about XOR is that it has some really neat properties. For example, if you XOR a number with itself, it cancels out leaving you with zero. And if you XOR a number with zero it stays the same. These properties are going to be really helpful because they allow us to simplify certain computations. Let's think about the properties of XOR for a second. We already know that XOR is associative and commutative meaning the order doesn't matter. also A XOR A = 0, and A XOR 0 = A. 

Now think what if we could somehow precompute some of these XOR operations Like, what if we had a way to quickly get the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to any given index.
Imagine we had an array that stored the cumulative XOR up to each index. So the first element would just be the first element of the original array, the second would be the first XOR'd with the second, the third would be that result XOR'd with the third element of the original array, and so on. I'm starting to see a pattern here. If we had this cumulative XOR array, couldn't we use it to quickly compute the XOR of any segment? Let's think about how that would work. Say we want the XOR of elements from index 2 to index 5. If we had the cumulative XOR up to index 5, that would include everything from the start to index 5. But we don't want everything from the start - we only want from index 2. So... what if we XOR'd the cumulative result up to index 5 with the cumulative result up to index 1 Because XOR is its own inverse operation, XORing with the cumulative result up to index 1 would effectively "cancel out" all the XOR operations before index 2, leaving us with exactly what we want! So we could precompute this cumulative XOR array once, and then use it to answer any query in constant time. That would be a huge improvement over recalculating everything for each query.

Let’s say we want the XOR of a subarray that starts at index `left` and ends at index `right`. If we’ve already calculated the XOR of the entire array up to `right`, and we’ve also calculated the XOR up to `left - 1`, we can get the XOR from `left` to `right` by removing the part of the array before `left`. In other words, the XOR from `left` to `right` is simply:

$XOR$ from left to right = $XOR$ up to right , ${XOR}$ , $XOR$ up to left - 1

This observation is important because it tells us that we can compute the XOR of any subarray if we know the XOR of the prefix (i.e., the XOR of all elements up to a certain point in the array).



So, here’s what we can do:

1. **Precompute the XOR values for prefixes:** We go through the array once and compute the XOR of all elements from the start up to each index. This will give us a quick reference for any subarray we might need later. For example, if we have an array `[1, 3, 4, 8]`, we would build a prefix XOR array where each element at index `i` gives us the XOR of all elements from index `0` to `i`.

2. **Use the prefix XOR array to answer queries:** Once we have this array, each query can be answered in constant time. For a query asking for the XOR from `left` to `right`, we just XOR the prefix XOR values at `right` and `left - 1`. If `left` is `0`, then we simply return the prefix XOR at `right` since it covers the entire range.

This approach ensures that we don’t have to repeatedly calculate the XOR for overlapping parts of the array. We’re essentially storing all the intermediate results in the prefix XOR array, which saves us a lot of time.


But do we really need a separate array for this We're already modifying the values as we go along, so what if we just stored the cumulative XOR directly in the input array? That would save us some space let's take a step back and think about potential issues. Are there any edge cases we need to worry about or What about queries that start at index 0 Or queries that cover the entire array, For queries starting at index 0, we wouldn't need to do any "cancelling out"  we could just return the cumulative XOR up to the end index directly. And for queries covering the whole array, it would be the same - just return the last element of our modified array.

Okay, I think we've got the makings of a solid approach here. Let's walk through it step by step:

1.  We start by modifying our input array in place. Each element will now represent the cumulative XOR of all elements up to and including that index.
2.  To do this, we iterate through the array once. For each element (except the first), we XOR it with the previous element. This gives us our cumulative XOR array.
3.  Now, when we get a query for the XOR of elements from index 'start' to index 'end', we can use our modified array to compute it quickly.
4.  If 'start' is greater than 0, we XOR the element at index 'end' with the element at index 'start - 1'. This effectively cancels out all the XOR operations before 'start', leaving us with the XOR of elements from 'start' to 'end'.
5.  If 'start' is 0, we just return the element at index 'end', since it already represents the cumulative XOR from 0 to 'end'.

we're only iterating through the array once to set it up, and then each query can be answered in constant time. We're also not using any extra space beyond the input array, which is nice.

But let's think about it a bit more. Are there any assumptions we're making that might not hold? Well, we're assuming that the input array isn't empty, but the problem statement says it will have at least one element, so we're good there.

We're also assuming that all the queries are valid - that the 'end' index is always greater than or equal to the 'start' index, and that both are within the bounds of the array. But again, the problem statement guarantees this, so we don't need to add any extra checks.

Let's talk about how we are using the properties of XOR in a clever way. We're using the fact that XOR is its own inverse to "undo" operations we don't want, which is pretty neat. It's a good reminder that understanding the mathematical properties of the operations we're working with can often lead to elegant solutions.
This solution does modify the input array. In some contexts, that might not be allowed or might have unintended consequences. If we needed to preserve the original array, we could use a separate array for the cumulative XOR values, at the cost of some extra space.

So Instead of creating a separate prefix XOR array, why not just modify the original array in place? This way, we can store the XOR values directly in the array itself, avoiding the need for extra space. It’s a minor optimization, but it can help reduce memory usage, especially for very large arrays and for each element in the array, starting from the second one, we replace it with the XOR of itself and the previous element. This transforms the array into a prefix XOR array without needing additional memory.


Let’s walk through the thought process of how we’d implement this.

1. **Initialize the prefix XOR in-place:** We start by modifying the array. For each element from index `1` onwards, we replace it with the XOR of itself and the element before it. This gives us the cumulative XOR up to that point.

2. **Process the queries:** Now, for each query, we can quickly compute the result. If the query starts at index `0`, the XOR value is simply the value at the end index in the modified array (since it already holds the XOR of all elements up to that point). If the query starts at some other index, we can XOR the value at the end index with the value just before the start index. This effectively cancels out the part of the array that we don’t need.

Let’s take an example to make it clearer.

Suppose we have the array `[1, 3, 4, 8]` and the queries `[[0, 1], [1, 2], [0, 3], [3, 3]]`. 

- First, we modify the array into a prefix XOR array:
  - Start with `[1, 3, 4, 8]`.
  - The second element becomes `1 XOR 3 = 2`, so the array becomes `[1, 2, 4, 8]`.
  - The third element becomes `2 XOR 4 = 6`, so the array becomes `[1, 2, 6, 8]`.
  - The fourth element becomes `6 XOR 8 = 14`, so the array becomes `[1, 2, 6, 14]`.

Now, when we process the queries:
- For the query `[0, 1]`, the answer is simply the value at index `1` in the modified array, which is `2`.
- For the query `[1, 2]`, the answer is `6 XOR 1 = 7`.
- For the query `[0, 3]`, the answer is the value at index `3`, which is `14`.
- For the query `[3, 3]`, the answer is the value at index `3`, which is `8`.

i.e [2,7,14,8]



To summarize the important thing was recognizing that recalculating the XOR for every query would involve a lot of redundant work. By using the properties of XOR and precomputing the XOR values for the array in advance, we can answer each query in constant time, even if the array is large or there are many queries. 

It’s all about spotting the patterns—once we realized that the XOR of a range could be derived from the XOR of the prefixes, everything fell into place. 
You might visualize this solution to make it clearer. Imagine a number line where each point represents an element in our array. As we move along the line, we're accumulating XOR operations. When we want to query a specific segment, we're essentially asking for the difference between two points on this line - but instead of subtraction, we're using XOR to "undo" the operations we don't want.

Think of how this solution scales. As the array gets larger, our preprocessing step takes longer, but it's still just linear time. And no matter how large the array gets, each query is still answered in constant time. That's a really nice property - it means that once we've done our initial work, we can handle any number of queries very efficiently.
