    "Most Android phones feature a security mechanism known as a lock pattern. It is a 3×3 grid of dots, where unmarked dots can be connected consecutively to create a pattern. More formally, from any dot in the grid, we can make 2 types of moves:\n",

    "## Approach 1: Backtracking\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "One approach to solving this problem involves generating all possible patterns and counting those that meet our specified conditions. Let's explore this method with a slight optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll create two arrays to represent each type of possible move: `SINGLE_STEP_MOVES` and `SKIP_DOT_MOVES`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find each pattern, we'll employ a recursive function countPatternsFromDot which explores all possible moves from the current dot under examination. We'll keep track of the dots explored at each step and start counting once the number of dots exceeds m. The recursion will continue until the current pattern reaches n dots, at which point it terminates. This function will successfully return all possible patterns from any given starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can often predict whether a path will yield a satisfactory pattern well before reaching its end. For instance, if at any point in the pattern's development, all potential next moves violate the rules, we can conclude that any patterns stemming from this state will be invalid. At any step, if we determine that the current path will not lead to a valid solution, we can abandon it and return to a previous step that still shows promise. This technique, known as backtracking, helps optimize our approach. If you're unfamiliar with it, consider reviewing this LeetCode [Explore Card](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/recursion-ii/472/backtracking/2654/) for a detailed explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a valid pattern can start from any dot, we'll call countPatternsFromDot for each of the nine dots and aggregate the results. This total count represents the required number of unlock patterns."

    "### Approach 3: Memoization\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "As we recursively construct each pattern, we often encounter sub-problems that we've previously solved. For example, in the sequences [7, 8, 5] and [8, 7, 5], the number of patterns emerging from 5 will be identical in both cases, as it depends solely on the current number and the dots visited thus far. To avoid repeatedly calculating these overlapping sub-problems, we can significantly improve our time complexity by optimizing our algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where dynamic programming comes in. The essence of dynamic programming is to save (memoize) the results of previously computed sub-problems, so that if we encounter the same sub-problem again, we can directly return the saved result instead of recalculating it. But how do we uniquely identify a sub-problem? The answer lies in its state. Each recursive state is defined by two factors: the current number from which the pattern emerges, and the dots visited up to that point. This state uniquely identifies each sub-problem, allowing us to store the result in a dp table using this state as the identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, storing all visited numbers in a boolean array is cumbersome to use as an identifier. We need something simpler, like an integer value. Considering the constraints of the problem, the maximum number of dots possible is 9. We can use a 9-digit binary number, where each digit can be a 0 or a 1, to represent whether a number has been visited (1) or not (0). This 9-digit binary number effectively replaces the visitedNumbers array, allowing us to memoize the recursion results in a `dp` table of size 10×(1<<10).\n",
    "\n",
    "To manipulate this new visitedNumbers integer, we need three essential functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.`setBit:` Toggles the `ith` bit of the number to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.`clearBit:` Toggles the `ith`bit of the number to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.`isSet:` Checks whether the `ith` bit is 0 or 1.\n",
