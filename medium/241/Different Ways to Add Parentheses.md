### Intuition
Alright, let's dive into this fascinating problem of computing different ways to group numbers and operators in an expression. This is a classic problem that touches on fundamental concepts in computer science and mathematics, particularly in the realm of parsing and evaluating expressions.

The essence of this problem lies in understanding how different groupings of operations can lead to different results, even when the sequence of numbers and operators remains the same. It's a bit like solving a puzzle where the pieces are fixed, but the way you arrange them can create entirely different pictures.

Let's start by breaking down what the problem is really asking us to do. We're given a string that represents a mathematical expression. This expression contains numbers and operators (+, -, *). Our job is to find all possible ways to evaluate this expression by grouping the operations differently.

Now, you might be wondering, "Why would different groupings lead to different results?" This is where the order of operations comes into play. In standard arithmetic, we have rules like PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction) that tell us which operations to perform first. But in this problem, we're essentially saying, "What if we could rearrange those parentheses?"

Consider the expression "2-1-1". Without any parentheses, we'd normally evaluate this from left to right: (2-1)-1 = 0. But what if we grouped it differently? (2-(1-1)) = 2. Same numbers, same operators, different result!

This is where things get interesting. We're not just calculating a single value; we're exploring a whole tree of possibilities. Each way of grouping the expression is like taking a different path through this tree of calculations.

Now, you might be thinking, "Couldn't this lead to a huge number of possibilities?" And you'd be right! This is why the problem statement includes a constraint: the number of different results doesn't exceed 10^4. This gives us a hint that while there might be many ways to group the expressions, many of these groupings will lead to the same final result.

So, how do we approach solving this systematically? This is where the concept of divide-and-conquer comes into play. Instead of trying to evaluate the entire expression at once, we can break it down into smaller subexpressions.

Imagine we have the expression "2*3-4*5". We could split this at any operator. For example:
- Split at the '-': (2*3) and (4*5)
- Split at the first '*': (2) and (3-4*5)
- Split at the second '*': (2*3-4) and (5)

Each of these splits creates two smaller subproblems. We can then recursively apply the same process to these subproblems until we reach a point where we're just dealing with a single number.

This recursive approach naturally leads us to think about using dynamic programming. Why? Because as we break down the expression, we'll often encounter the same subexpressions multiple times. By storing the results of these subexpressions, we can avoid redundant calculations.

Let's delve deeper into the mathematical intuition behind this approach. We can think of our expression as a function f(i,j) where i and j are the start and end indices of a subexpression in our original string. The value of f(i,j) is the set of all possible results from evaluating the subexpression from index i to j.

Now, we can formulate a recurrence relation:

f(i,j) = { x | x = a op b, where a ∈ f(i,k), b ∈ f(k+1,j), and expression[k] is an operator, for all k where i ≤ k < j }

In simpler terms, this means that to calculate f(i,j), we consider all possible ways to split the expression between i and j at an operator. For each split, we compute all possible results from the left side (a) and all possible results from the right side (b), then combine them using the operator at the split point.

This recurrence relation forms the core of our dynamic programming approach. It allows us to build up solutions for larger subexpressions from solutions to smaller subexpressions.

One might wonder, "How do we handle the base case?" The base case occurs when our subexpression contains no operators - it's just a single number. In this case, we simply return that number as the only possible result.

As we implement this solution, we need to be mindful of a few things:
1. How do we efficiently store and retrieve results for subexpressions?
2. How do we ensure we don't miss any possible groupings?
3. How do we handle the different operators (+, -, *) in a clean and extensible way?

These considerations lead us naturally to a solution that uses recursion with memoization. We can use a 2D array to store results for each subexpression, indexed by the start and end positions of the subexpression in the original string.

This approach has several advantages:
1. It naturally handles the recursive nature of the problem.
2. It avoids redundant calculations by storing and reusing results for subexpressions.
3. It's flexible enough to handle different operators without needing to change the core logic.
4. It can easily be extended to handle additional operators if needed.

One potential pitfall to be aware of is the handling of negative numbers. Our approach assumes that all numbers in the expression are non-negative (as stated in the problem constraints). If we needed to handle negative numbers, we'd need to be more careful about how we parse the expression.

Another interesting aspect to consider is the time and space complexity of this solution. At first glance, it might seem like we'd need to generate an enormous number of possibilities. However, the memoization helps us avoid redundant calculations, significantly reducing the time complexity.

In terms of space complexity, we're storing results for every subexpression, which might seem expensive. However, the constraint that the number of different results doesn't exceed 10^4 puts an upper bound on how much space we actually need.

As we implement this solution, we might ask ourselves questions like:
- How can we efficiently parse the numbers in the expression?
- What's the best way to handle the different operators?
- How can we ensure we're covering all possible groupings?

These questions guide us towards an implementation that is both efficient and correct.

In conclusion, this problem is a beautiful example of how breaking down a complex problem into smaller, manageable pieces can lead to an elegant solution. It showcases the power of recursive thinking and dynamic programming, while also touching on important concepts in expression evaluation and combinatorics.

The approach we've discussed provides a solid foundation for solving this problem, but it's worth noting that there are always opportunities for optimization and refinement. As with many problems in computer science, the journey of solving it often teaches us as much as the final solution itself.


**Top Down**


Core Algorithm Overview:

The central idea of this approach is to recursively break down the expression into smaller subexpressions, compute all possible results for these subexpressions, and then combine them in all possible ways. We use memoization to avoid redundant calculations, which is a key optimization in this solution.

Let's start with a high-level pseudo-code of the main function:

```
function diffWaysToCompute(expression):
    initialize 2D array memo[length][length]
    return evaluateExpression(0, length - 1)

function evaluateExpression(startIndex, endIndex):
    if memo[startIndex][endIndex] is not null:
        return memo[startIndex][endIndex]
    
    results = new List()
    containsOperator = false
    
    for i from startIndex to endIndex:
        if expression[i] is an operator:
            containsOperator = true
            leftResults = evaluateExpression(startIndex, i - 1)
            rightResults = evaluateExpression(i + 1, endIndex)
            
            for each leftValue in leftResults:
                for each rightValue in rightResults:
                    result = apply operator at i to leftValue and rightValue
                    add result to results
    
    if not containsOperator:
        parse number from startIndex to endIndex
        add parsed number to results
    
    memo[startIndex][endIndex] = results
    return results
```

Now, let's break down each part of this algorithm and explain the reasoning behind it.

1. Memoization Setup:

We use a 2D array `memo` to store the results of subexpressions. The indices of this array correspond to the start and end indices of subexpressions in the original expression string.

```
initialize 2D array memo[length][length]
```

This memoization is crucial for the efficiency of our algorithm. Without it, we would end up recalculating the same subexpressions multiple times, leading to exponential time complexity. With memoization, we calculate each subexpression only once and reuse the results, significantly reducing the time complexity.

2. Recursive Function - evaluateExpression:

This is the heart of our algorithm. It takes two parameters: `startIndex` and `endIndex`, which define the boundaries of the current subexpression we're evaluating.

```
function evaluateExpression(startIndex, endIndex):
```

The function aims to compute all possible results for the subexpression from `startIndex` to `endIndex` in the original expression.

3. Memoization Check:

Before doing any computation, we first check if we've already calculated the results for this subexpression:

```
if memo[startIndex][endIndex] is not null:
    return memo[startIndex][endIndex]
```

This check is what turns our recursive algorithm into a dynamic programming solution. If we've seen this subexpression before, we can immediately return the cached results, avoiding redundant calculations.

4. Iterating Through the Subexpression:

We iterate through each character in the current subexpression:

```
for i from startIndex to endIndex:
    if expression[i] is an operator:
```

This loop is looking for operators (+, -, *) in the current subexpression. Each operator represents a potential splitting point for our divide-and-conquer strategy.

5. Divide and Conquer:

When we find an operator, we split the expression at that point and recursively evaluate the left and right subexpressions:

```
leftResults = evaluateExpression(startIndex, i - 1)
rightResults = evaluateExpression(i + 1, endIndex)
```

This is the "divide" part of our divide-and-conquer approach. We're breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.

6. Combining Results:

After getting the results from the left and right subexpressions, we combine them using the current operator:

```
for each leftValue in leftResults:
    for each rightValue in rightResults:
        result = apply operator at i to leftValue and rightValue
        add result to results
```

This is the "conquer" part of our strategy. We're combining the solutions of our subproblems to solve the larger problem. We consider all possible combinations of results from the left and right subexpressions, applying the operator to each pair.

7. Base Case - Single Number:

If we don't find any operators in the current subexpression, it means we're dealing with a single number:

```
if not containsOperator:
    parse number from startIndex to endIndex
    add parsed number to results
```

This is our base case. When we reach a subexpression that's just a number, we parse it and return it as the only possible result for this subexpression.

8. Memoization Storage:

Before returning, we store the computed results in our memoization array:

```
memo[startIndex][endIndex] = results
return results
```

This step ensures that if we ever need to evaluate this same subexpression again, we can retrieve the results directly from `memo` instead of recomputing them.

Mathematical and Logical Concepts:

1. Associativity of Operations:
   The core idea behind this problem is the associativity of arithmetic operations. For example, in the expression "2-1-1", we can compute it as (2-1)-1 or 2-(1-1), leading to different results. Our algorithm systematically explores all these possibilities.

2. Recursive Problem Decomposition:
   We're using the mathematical principle that an expression can be evaluated by:
   a) Evaluating its subexpressions
   b) Combining the results using the operators
   This naturally leads to a recursive solution.

3. Combinatorial Explosion and Memoization:
   The number of ways to parenthesize an expression grows exponentially with the number of operators. However, many of these parenthesizations lead to the same numerical results. Memoization allows us to store and reuse these results, dramatically reducing the effective complexity of our solution.

4. Dynamic Programming Principle of Optimal Substructure:
   Our solution leverages the fact that the optimal solution to the larger problem (evaluating the whole expression) can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems (evaluating subexpressions). This is a key principle of dynamic programming.

Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity: 
Without memoization, the time complexity would be exponential, roughly O(3^n) where n is the number of operators in the expression. This is because for each operator, we have three choices: make it the root of the current expression tree, or recurse on the left or right subexpression.

With memoization, we significantly reduce this. In the worst case, we fill out the entire memo table, which has O(n^2) entries (one for each possible subexpression). For each entry, we might need to consider all possible split points, which is O(n). So the overall time complexity becomes O(n^3).

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n^2) for the memoization table, plus the recursion stack depth of O(n). The actual space used might be less due to the constraint that the number of unique results doesn't exceed 10^4.

Potential Optimizations and Extensions:

1. Parsing Optimization: We could potentially optimize the parsing of numbers by pre-processing the expression to identify all numbers and operators upfront.

2. Operator Precedence: If we wanted to respect standard operator precedence (e.g., multiplication before addition), we'd need to modify our algorithm to prioritize certain operators.

3. Additional Operators: The current structure allows for easy addition of new operators. We'd just need to extend the operator application logic.

4. Parallel Processing: The recursive nature of this algorithm lends itself well to parallel processing. Different branches of the recursion tree could potentially be evaluated concurrently.

In conclusion, this solution elegantly combines recursive thinking with dynamic programming to solve a problem that at first glance might seem to require brute-force enumeration of all possibilities. By breaking down the expression into subexpressions and memoizing results, we achieve a solution that is both correct and efficient. The approach demonstrates the power of divide-and-conquer strategies in reducing complex problems to manageable subproblems, and showcases how dynamic programming can optimize recursive solutions by eliminating redundant calculations.

### Intuition
Building on our previous discussion about computing different ways to group numbers and operators in an expression, let's delve into the evolution of our thinking process and the development of our final approach. This journey of problem-solving is as enlightening as the solution itself, showcasing how we can refine our ideas to create more efficient and elegant algorithms.

Our initial approach, which we'll call Approach 1, was a recursive solution with memoization. This method was intuitive and aligned well with how we might manually solve the problem. We broke the expression down into smaller subexpressions, solved these recursively, and combined the results. The use of memoization helped us avoid redundant calculations, which is crucial for efficiency.

However, as we worked with this solution, we began to notice some limitations. While it worked well, the recursive nature of the algorithm meant that we were still potentially making many function calls, which can be expensive in terms of stack space. Additionally, the top-down approach meant that we might be calculating some subproblems before we actually needed them.

This realization led us to consider a bottom-up approach, which became our Approach 2. In this method, we used dynamic programming to build up our solution iteratively. We started with the smallest subproblems (single numbers) and gradually built up to larger subexpressions.

The key insight here was that we could represent our subproblems in a 2D table, where each cell [i][j] represents all possible results for the subexpression from index i to j in our original expression. This tabular structure allowed us to visualize our problem space more clearly and fill it in a systematic way.

Approach 2 had several advantages over our initial recursive solution:

1. It eliminated the need for recursive function calls, reducing stack overhead.
2. It ensured that we only calculated each subproblem once, in a predictable order.
3. It made the solution more iterative and potentially easier to understand and debug.

However, as we implemented and tested Approach 2, we realized there was still room for improvement. We were parsing the expression on the fly, which meant we were doing string operations in our main computation loop. We also noticed that our code structure could be more modular, making it easier to maintain and extend.

These observations led us to our final approach, which we can think of as a refined and optimized version of Approach 2. The key improvements in this final version are:

1. Preprocessing: We now parse the expression upfront, separating numbers and operators. This allows us to work with integer values and character operators directly in our main algorithm, avoiding string parsing overhead.

2. Modularization: We've broken our solution into smaller, focused functions. This not only makes the code more readable but also allows for easier testing and potential reuse of components.

3. Explicit handling of constraints: We've added constants for maximum expression length and maximum number value, making it easier to adjust these if needed and potentially optimize memory usage.

The mathematical intuition behind this approach can be formalized as follows:

Let f(i, j) represent the set of all possible results for the subexpression from index i to j in our list of numbers.

Our base case is: f(i, i) = {numbers[i]}

For i < j, we have the recurrence relation:

f(i, j) = { x | x = a op b, where a ∈ f(i, k), b ∈ f(k+1, j), and operators[k] = op, for all k where i ≤ k < j }

This formulation captures the essence of our dynamic programming approach. We're building up our solution by combining results from smaller subproblems.

One might ask, "Why is this approach superior to the previous ones?" The answer lies in its balance of efficiency and clarity. By preprocessing the expression, we've reduced the computational overhead in our main loop. The modular structure makes the code more maintainable and easier to reason about. And by retaining the bottom-up dynamic programming approach, we ensure that we're solving each subproblem exactly once, in an order that guarantees all dependencies are resolved.

An analogy that might help illustrate this approach is building a pyramid. We start with individual blocks (our numbers) at the base. Each level up represents combining these blocks in different ways (our operators). As we build higher, we have more options for how to combine the lower levels, but we always build on what we've already constructed. Our final result is at the top of the pyramid, representing all possible ways to evaluate the entire expression.

As we developed this solution, we had to consider several important questions:

1. How do we efficiently parse the expression without losing information?
2. What's the most effective way to store and combine intermediate results?
3. How can we ensure we're covering all possible groupings without unnecessary repetition?

These questions guided us towards our final implementation. The parsing step allows us to work with clean, separated data. Our 2D table structure provides an efficient way to store and access intermediate results. And our systematic filling of the table ensures we cover all possibilities exactly once.

One potential pitfall we had to be careful of was the handling of multi-digit numbers. Our parsing function needed to correctly identify these as single numbers rather than treating each digit separately. This is why we accumulate digits until we encounter an operator.

Another consideration was the order of operations. In standard arithmetic, multiplication would take precedence over addition and subtraction. However, in this problem, we're considering all possible groupings, so we treat all operators equally. This is reflected in our approach of trying all possible split points between numbers.

The edge cases we needed to consider included:
1. Expressions with a single number
2. Expressions with the maximum allowed length
3. Expressions containing the maximum allowed number value

Our approach handles these naturally. Single-number expressions are covered by our base case initialization. The maximum length and number value are accounted for in our constants and don't affect the core algorithm.

In terms of time complexity, our solution is O(n^3), where n is the number of numbers in the expression. This comes from our three nested loops: one for the subexpression length, one for the start index, and one for the split point. While this might seem high, it's actually quite efficient given the nature of the problem. We're exhaustively exploring all possibilities, and this complexity is hard to improve upon without making assumptions about the structure of the expression.

The space complexity is O(n^2) due to our 2D table. Each cell in this table could potentially contain all possible results for that subexpression, but the problem constraints (maximum 10^4 different results) keep this manageable.

In conclusion, our final approach represents a careful balance of efficiency, clarity, and robustness. It's the result of iterative refinement, taking the strengths of our previous approaches and addressing their weaknesses. While there might always be room for further optimization in specific scenarios, this solution provides a strong foundation for tackling this class of problems.

The journey from our initial recursive solution to this final dynamic programming approach illustrates a common pattern in algorithm development. We often start with a more intuitive, top-down approach, then refine it into a more efficient, bottom-up solution. Along the way, we gain insights that allow us to optimize further, resulting in a solution that's not just faster, but also clearer and more maintainable.

This problem and our approach to solving it touch on fundamental concepts in computer science and mathematics, from expression parsing to dynamic programming. It's a testament to the power of breaking complex problems into manageable subproblems and systematically building up to a comprehensive solution. As we solve more problems like this, we develop a toolkit of techniques and intuitions that we can apply to a wide range of computational challenges.

### Approach 3 Bootom up optimized
Let's dive into a comprehensive explanation of our final approach to solving the problem of computing all possible results from different groupings of numbers and operators in an expression. This solution leverages dynamic programming and careful preprocessing to efficiently tackle the problem.

Core Algorithm Overview:
Our approach can be broken down into three main steps:
1. Preprocessing the expression
2. Initializing the dynamic programming table
3. Filling the dynamic programming table

Let's examine each of these steps in detail:

1. Preprocessing the Expression:
Before we begin our main computation, we parse the input expression into two separate lists: one for numbers and one for operators. This preprocessing step allows us to work with clean, easily manipulable data in our main algorithm.

Pseudo-code for preprocessing:

```
function parseExpression(expression):
    numbers = empty list
    operators = empty list
    currentNumber = 0
    
    for each character c in expression:
        if c is a digit:
            currentNumber = currentNumber * 10 + (c as integer)
        else:
            numbers.add(currentNumber)
            currentNumber = 0
            operators.add(c)
    
    numbers.add(currentNumber)  // Add the last number
    
    return numbers, operators
```

This preprocessing step is crucial because it simplifies our main algorithm. Instead of constantly parsing the string during computation, we can work directly with numbers and operators. It also handles multi-digit numbers correctly, which is an important consideration for this problem.

2. Initializing the Dynamic Programming Table:
Our dynamic programming table is a 2D structure where each cell [i][j] represents all possible results for the subexpression from the i-th number to the j-th number (inclusive).

Pseudo-code for initialization:

```
function initializeTable(numbers):
    n = length of numbers
    table = new 2D array of size n x n, initialized with empty lists
    
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        table[i][i] = [numbers[i]]
    
    return table
```

This initialization sets up our base cases. Each number by itself is a valid subexpression with only one possible result.

3. Filling the Dynamic Programming Table:
This is the heart of our algorithm. We systematically fill the table, building up from smaller subexpressions to larger ones.

Pseudo-code for filling the table:

```
function fillTable(numbers, operators, table):
    n = length of numbers
    
    for len from 2 to n:
        for i from 0 to n - len:
            j = i + len - 1
            for k from i to j-1:
                leftResults = table[i][k]
                rightResults = table[k+1][j]
                op = operators[k]
                
                for each leftValue in leftResults:
                    for each rightValue in rightResults:
                        result = applyOperator(leftValue, rightValue, op)
                        table[i][j].add(result)
    
    return table[0][n-1]  // Results for the entire expression

function applyOperator(left, right, op):
    if op is '+':
        return left + right
    else if op is '-':
        return left - right
    else if op is '*':
        return left * right
    else:
        throw error "Invalid operator"
```

Let's break down this core algorithm and understand why it works:

1. We iterate over all possible lengths of subexpressions, from 2 to n (where n is the number of numbers in the expression).

2. For each length, we consider all possible starting positions i.

3. For each subexpression from i to j, we try all possible ways to split it into two parts.

4. For each split point k, we combine all results from the left part (i to k) with all results from the right part (k+1 to j) using the operator at position k.

5. We store all these combined results in table[i][j].

The magic of this approach lies in its systematic build-up from smaller subproblems to larger ones. By the time we need to compute the results for a large subexpression, we've already computed and stored the results for all its possible smaller components.

Mathematical Intuition:
Let's formalize the logic behind this approach mathematically. Define f(i,j) as the set of all possible results for the subexpression from the i-th number to the j-th number.

Base case: f(i,i) = {numbers[i]}

Recurrence relation: For i < j,
f(i,j) = { x | x = a op b, where a ∈ f(i,k), b ∈ f(k+1,j), and operators[k] = op, for all k where i ≤ k < j }

This recurrence relation captures the essence of our algorithm. We're building up our solution by combining results from smaller subproblems in all possible ways.

Why This Approach Works:
1. Completeness: By considering all possible split points and combining all results from the left and right sides, we ensure that we generate all possible results for each subexpression.

2. Optimal Substructure: The result for a larger expression can be computed from the results of its smaller components. This property is crucial for the validity of our dynamic programming approach.

3. Overlapping Subproblems: Many subexpressions are reused in different larger expressions. By storing the results for each subexpression, we avoid redundant computations.

4. Bottom-up Computation: By building up from smaller subexpressions to larger ones, we ensure that when we need to compute a result, all its components have already been computed.

Time and Space Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n^3 * 4^n) in the worst case, where n is the number of numbers in the expression.
- We have three nested loops: for length (n iterations), for start position (n iterations), and for split point (n iterations).
- At each step, we might be combining two lists of results, each potentially having up to 4^(n/2) elements in the worst case.
- However, the problem constraints limit the number of different results to 10^4, so in practice, the complexity is closer to O(n^3).

Space Complexity: O(n^2 * m), where m is the maximum number of different results for any subexpression (limited to 10^4 by the problem constraints).
- We use a 2D table of size n x n, where each cell can contain up to m results.

Handling Edge Cases and Constraints:
1. Single Number: Handled naturally by our base case initialization.
2. Maximum Expression Length (20): We can use this to optimize our table size if needed.
3. Maximum Number Value (99): This doesn't affect our algorithm directly but helps bound the range of possible results.
4. Maximum Number of Different Results (10^4): This constraint keeps our space complexity manageable.

Potential Optimizations:
1. Result Deduplication: If many operations lead to the same result, we could use a set instead of a list to store unique results.
2. Early Termination: If we reach the maximum number of different results for a subexpression, we could stop generating more.
3. Parallelization: The computations for different cells in the same diagonal of our table are independent and could potentially be parallelized.

In conclusion, this solution elegantly combines preprocessing, dynamic programming, and systematic computation to solve a complex problem efficiently. By breaking down the expression into smaller subproblems and building up the solution methodically, we ensure that we consider all possibilities without redundant computation.

This approach demonstrates key problem-solving principles:
1. Simplify the input (preprocessing)
2. Break the problem into smaller, manageable subproblems (dynamic programming)
3. Build the solution systematically from bottom to top
4. Use stored results to avoid redundant computations

Understanding this solution provides insights applicable to a wide range of problems involving expression evaluation, combinatorial generation, and dynamic programming. The techniques used here – like the way we parse the input, structure our dynamic programming table, and systematically build up our solution – can be adapted to solve many related problems in algorithm design and computation.
