### Intuition
Certainly! Let's dive into a comprehensive intuition for your approach to the missing dice rolls problem. I'll walk through the thought process, discussing the evolution of ideas and key insights that lead to the solution.

Understanding the Problem

Let's start by breaking down what we're really being asked to do here. We have a scenario where we've rolled some dice, but we've lost track of a few of the results. We know how many dice we rolled in total (n + m), how many results we still have (m), and what the average value of all the rolls was (mean). Our job is to figure out what those missing rolls (n) could have been.

This is an interesting problem because it's not just about finding any set of numbers that fit. We need to consider that these are dice rolls, which means each number must be between 1 and 6. We also need to make sure that when we combine our proposed missing rolls with the known rolls, we end up with exactly the average we were given.

The constraints given in the problem are crucial. We're dealing with potentially large numbers of dice (up to 10^5), which means we need to be mindful of efficiency. We also know that the mean is an integer, which simplifies our calculations somewhat.

Evolution of Thinking

When approaching this problem, my mind first went to a brute force solution. What if we tried all possible combinations of dice rolls for the missing n dice? We could generate every possibility and check if it gives us the correct mean when combined with the known rolls.

But let's think about that for a moment. If we have n missing dice, and each die has 6 possible values, we're looking at 6^n possible combinations. Even for a small n, this quickly becomes computationally infeasible. For example, with just 10 missing dice, we'd have to check over 60 million combinations!

So, we need to be smarter about this. What information can we derive from what we're given?

We know the total number of dice (n + m) and the average (mean). This immediately tells us something crucial: we can calculate the sum of all dice rolls. It's simply (n + m) * mean. This is our first key insight.

Now, we also know the sum of the m rolls we have. What if we subtract this from the total sum? We'd be left with the sum of the missing rolls!

This leads us to our second key insight: we don't need to guess individual rolls. We just need to find a way to distribute this missing sum across n dice.

Refining the Approach

At this point, we've simplified our problem considerably. We're no longer trying to guess individual rolls; we're trying to distribute a known sum across a known number of dice.

But we're not done yet. We need to consider our constraints. Each die roll must be between 1 and 6. This means our missing sum must be at least n (if all missing rolls were 1) and at most 6n (if all missing rolls were 6).

If our calculated missing sum falls outside this range, we know immediately that there's no valid solution. This is a crucial check that can save us a lot of unnecessary work.

Assuming our sum is valid, how do we distribute it? The most straightforward way would be to divide the sum by n, giving us an average value for each missing roll. But remember, we need integer values between 1 and 6.

This leads us to our final key insight: we can use integer division to get a base value for each roll, and then distribute the remainder as needed.

Mathematical Insight

Let's formalize this mathematically. If we call our missing sum S and the number of missing rolls n, we're essentially solving this equation:

S = x₁ + x₂ + ... + xₙ

Where 1 ≤ xᵢ ≤ 6 for all i.

We can start by setting each xᵢ to ⌊S/n⌋ (the floor of S divided by n). This gives us:

S = n * ⌊S/n⌋ + r

Where r is the remainder of S divided by n.

Now, we just need to distribute r among the n values, ensuring none exceeds 6. We can do this by adding 1 to the first r values.

This approach guarantees that we'll always get a valid distribution if one exists, and it does so in a single pass through the data.

Why This Approach Works

This solution is elegant because it sidesteps the combinatorial explosion of the brute force approach. Instead of guessing, we're using the given information to directly calculate what we need.

It's also efficient. We only need to iterate through the known rolls once to calculate their sum, and then through the missing rolls once to distribute the values. This gives us a linear time complexity, which is crucial given the potential size of the input.

Moreover, this approach naturally handles edge cases. If the missing sum is too large or too small to be distributed among the dice, we'll catch that immediately. If there are multiple valid solutions (which is often the case), this method will always find one of them.

Conclusion

In essence, we've transformed a problem that initially seemed to require guesswork into a straightforward calculation and distribution problem. We've leveraged the constraints of the problem (dice values, integer mean) to our advantage, allowing us to make definitive statements about the missing rolls without having to explore a vast solution space.

This approach demonstrates the power of stepping back and looking at the big picture. Instead of focusing on individual dice rolls, we considered the sum as a whole, which led to a much simpler and more efficient solution.

As we solve problems like this, it's crucial to always be on the lookout for such simplifying insights. Often, the key to an elegant solution lies not in complex algorithms, but in recognizing patterns and relationships within the problem itself.

### Appraoch 
Certainly! Let's dive into a comprehensive explanation of the approach and implementation for solving the "Missing Dice Rolls" problem. We'll focus on the underlying logic and concepts, using language-agnostic explanations and pseudo-code to illustrate key points.

Problem Overview:
Before we delve into the solution, let's recap the problem:
- We have n+m dice rolls, each showing a value from 1 to 6.
- We know the values of m rolls, but n rolls are missing.
- We're given the average (mean) of all n+m rolls.
- Our task is to determine possible values for the n missing rolls.

Core Concept:
The key insight that drives our solution is the relationship between the sum of all rolls and the given mean. This allows us to calculate the sum of the missing rolls without knowing their individual values.

Detailed Approach:

1. Calculate the Sum of Known Rolls

First, we need to find the sum of the m known rolls. This is a straightforward process:

```
function calculateKnownSum(rolls):
    sum = 0
    for each roll in rolls:
        sum = sum + roll
    return sum
```

This function iterates through the array of known rolls, accumulating their sum. The time complexity is O(m), where m is the number of known rolls.

2. Calculate the Total Sum

We can derive the total sum of all rolls (both known and missing) using the given mean:

```
totalSum = mean * (n + m)
```

This works because the mean is defined as the sum of all values divided by the count of values. By multiplying the mean by the total number of rolls (n + m), we reverse this calculation to get the total sum.

3. Calculate the Sum of Missing Rolls

Now that we have the total sum and the sum of known rolls, we can easily calculate the sum of the missing rolls:

```
missingSummissingSum = totalSum - knownSum
```

4. Validate the Missing Sum

Before we proceed, we need to check if it's possible to distribute the missing sum among n dice rolls. Remember, each die can show a value from 1 to 6. Therefore:
- The minimum possible sum for n dice is n * 1 = n
- The maximum possible sum for n dice is n * 6 = 6n

We can express this check in pseudo-code:

```
if missingSum < n or missingSum > 6 * n:
    return empty array  // No valid solution exists
```

If the missing sum falls outside this range, it's impossible to distribute it among n dice rolls, so we return an empty array to indicate no solution.

5. Distribute the Missing Sum

If we've passed the validation check, we know it's possible to distribute the missing sum among n dice. Now we need to determine how to do this distribution.

The most equitable way to distribute the sum is to try to make all dice values as close to each other as possible. We can achieve this by:
a) Finding the average value per die
b) Distributing any remainder

Here's how we can do this:

```
baseValue = missingSum / n  // Integer division
remainder = missingSum % n

Create an array result of size n, initialized with baseValue

for i from 0 to remainder - 1:
    result[i] = result[i] + 1

return result
```

Let's break this down:

a) `baseValue = missingSum / n`: This performs integer division, giving us the largest value we can assign to each die while ensuring we don't exceed the missing sum.

b) `remainder = missingSum % n`: This calculates how much is left over after distributing the base value to each die.

c) We create a result array of size n and initialize each element with the base value.

d) We then distribute the remainder by adding 1 to the first `remainder` elements of the array.

This distribution method ensures that:
- The sum of all values in the result array equals the missing sum.
- The difference between any two values in the result array is at most 1.
- All values are integers between 1 and 6 (assuming we passed the earlier validation check).

Mathematical Proof of Correctness:

Let's prove that this distribution method always works if we've passed the validation check:

1) After distributing the base value, the sum of all elements is:
   n * baseValue

2) After distributing the remainder, the sum becomes:
   n * baseValue + remainder

3) By the definitions of integer division and modulo:
   missingSum = n * baseValue + remainder

Therefore, the sum of all elements in our result array exactly equals the missing sum.

Now, let's prove that all values are between 1 and 6:

- The minimum value in the array is baseValue, which is at least 1 because missingSum ≥ n (from our validation check).
- The maximum value in the array is baseValue + 1, which is at most 6 because:
  missingSum ≤ 6n (from our validation check)
  baseValue = missingSum / n ≤ 6
  Therefore, baseValue + 1 ≤ 7, and since baseValue is an integer, baseValue + 1 ≤ 6

Thus, we've proven that our distribution method always produces a valid solution when one exists.

Time and Space Complexity:

Time Complexity: O(n + m)
- We iterate through the m known rolls once to calculate their sum: O(m)
- We perform constant-time calculations to get the missing sum
- We create and populate an array of size n: O(n)
Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n + m).

Space Complexity: O(n)
- We create a result array of size n.
- All other variables use constant space.

Therefore, the space complexity is O(n).

Complete Algorithm:

Here's a pseudo-code representation of the complete algorithm:

```
function missingRolls(rolls, mean, n):
    m = length of rolls
    knownSum = calculateKnownSum(rolls)
    totalSum = mean * (n + m)
    missingSum = totalSum - knownSum

    if missingSum < n or missingSum > 6 * n:
        return empty array

    baseValue = missingSum / n
    remainder = missingSum % n

    result = new array of size n, initialized with baseValue

    for i from 0 to remainder - 1:
        result[i] = result[i] + 1

    return result

function calculateKnownSum(rolls):
    sum = 0
    for each roll in rolls:
        sum = sum + roll
    return sum
```

This algorithm efficiently solves the "Missing Dice Rolls" problem by leveraging mathematical relationships to avoid guesswork or complex calculations. It guarantees a solution when one exists and correctly identifies impossible scenarios.

The approach demonstrates the power of mathematical thinking in algorithm design. By understanding the constraints of the problem (dice values from 1 to 6, integer mean) and the relationships between the given values (total rolls, known rolls, mean), we transform what initially seems like a combinatorial problem into a straightforward calculation and distribution task.

This solution is not only efficient but also elegant in its simplicity. It shows how a deep understanding of the problem's mathematical properties can lead to an algorithm that's both easy to implement and easy to prove correct.

In applying this solution to similar problems, remember the key steps:
1. Identify the mathematical relationships in the problem.
2. Use these relationships to transform the problem into a simpler form.
3. Validate the transformed problem to ensure a solution is possible.
4. Develop an efficient method to construct the solution.
5. Prove the correctness of your method mathematically.

By following these steps, you can often turn complex-seeming problems into straightforward algorithmic solutions.
