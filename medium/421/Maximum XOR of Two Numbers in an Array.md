Let's dive into the problem of finding the maximum XOR of any two numbers in an array. At its core, this challenge asks us to explore the bitwise properties of numbers and leverage them to find an optimal solution.

The problem seems straightforward at first glance - we need to find two numbers in the array that, when XORed together, produce the largest possible result. However, the constraints make it clear that a brute force approach of trying all possible pairs won't cut it. With up to 2 * 10^5 elements in the array, we'd be looking at roughly 2 * 10^10 comparisons in the worst case. That's far too slow for our needs.

So, how do we approach this more efficiently? The key insight comes from understanding the nature of XOR and how it relates to binary representations of numbers.

XOR has some interesting properties that we can exploit. When we XOR two numbers, we're essentially comparing their bits one by one. If the bits are different, we get a 1 in that position in the result. If they're the same, we get a 0. This means that to maximize our XOR result, we want to find pairs of numbers that differ in as many bit positions as possible, especially in the most significant bits.

This realization leads us to a critical question: How can we efficiently find pairs of numbers that differ in their most significant bits?

One approach that might come to mind is to sort the array and compare numbers that are far apart. While this could work in some cases, it doesn't guarantee the optimal solution and still requires checking multiple pairs.

A more promising direction is to consider the binary representations of our numbers directly. What if we could build our solution bit by bit, starting from the most significant bit?

This line of thinking brings us to the concept of prefix matching. In binary, a prefix is just the first few bits of a number. If we could efficiently check which prefixes exist in our array, we could potentially construct the maximum XOR result one bit at a time.

But how do we store and check these prefixes efficiently? This is where data structures come into play. Two common approaches emerge:

1. Using a HashSet to store prefixes
2. Using a Trie (prefix tree) to organize our prefixes

Both of these approaches allow us to check for the existence of a prefix in constant time, which is crucial for maintaining our desired O(N) time complexity.

The HashSet approach is conceptually simpler. We can iterate through our numbers, building up prefixes bit by bit. At each step, we check if there exists a complementary prefix that would give us a 1 in the current bit position of our XOR result.

The Trie approach, while slightly more complex to implement, provides a more intuitive visualization of what we're doing. We're essentially building a binary tree where each path from root to leaf represents a number in our array. This structure allows us to efficiently navigate and compare prefixes.

Both approaches follow a similar logical flow:

1. Determine the position of the most significant bit across all numbers in the array.
2. Iterate from the most significant bit down to the least significant bit.
3. For each bit position, try to construct a prefix that would give us a 1 in that position of our XOR result.
4. If such a prefix exists, we know we can achieve a 1 in that bit position in our final result.
5. Move on to the next bit position and repeat.

This bit-by-bit construction is the key to our solution's efficiency. Instead of checking all possible pairs, we're making intelligent decisions at each bit position based on the prefixes we've seen so far.

One potential pitfall to be aware of is the handling of leading zeros. We need to ensure that all numbers are considered with the same number of bits, padding with zeros as necessary. This is why finding the most significant bit position across all numbers is an important first step.

Another consideration is how to handle edge cases, such as an array with all identical numbers or an array with only one number. Our approach naturally handles these cases without special treatment, which is a good sign of a robust solution.

The beauty of this approach is that it scales well with larger numbers. Whether we're dealing with 32-bit integers or even larger numbers, the principle remains the same. We're always working with a fixed number of bit positions, regardless of the size of our array.

As we implement this solution, we'll find that the core logic remains quite compact. The complexity comes from efficiently managing our prefixes and constructing our result bit by bit.

In essence, we're trading the brute force comparison of all pairs for a more intelligent, targeted search through the binary representations of our numbers. We're leveraging the properties of XOR and the structure of binary numbers to guide our search towards the optimal solution.

This approach not only solves our immediate problem but also introduces techniques that can be applied to a wide range of bitwise operations and prefix-matching problems. It's a prime example of how understanding the underlying properties of our data and operations can lead to elegant and efficient solutions

### Approach



Approach Overview:
Our solution leverages the bitwise properties of XOR and the binary representation of numbers to efficiently find the maximum XOR value. Instead of comparing all possible pairs of numbers (which would be too slow), we construct the maximum XOR result bit by bit, starting from the most significant bit.

Key Concepts:

1. Binary Representation: We work with the binary form of numbers, focusing on individual bit positions.

2. Prefix Matching: We use prefixes (the leftmost bits) of numbers to make decisions.

3. Greedy Bit Construction: We build our result from left to right, always trying to set the current bit to 1 if possible.

4. Set-based Lookup: We use a set data structure for efficient prefix checking.

Algorithm Breakdown:

1. Find the Maximum Number:
   First, we need to determine the position of the most significant bit (MSB) across all numbers in the array. We do this by finding the maximum number in the array.

   Pseudo-code:
   ```
   function findMaxNumber(nums):
       max = 0
       for each num in nums:
           if num > max:
               max = num
       return max
   ```

2. Find the Most Significant Bit Position:
   Once we have the maximum number, we can determine the position of its most significant bit. This tells us how many bits we need to consider for all numbers.

   Pseudo-code:
   ```
   function findMSBPosition(num):
       for i from 31 down to 0:
           if (num AND (1 << i)) != 0:
               return i
       return 0
   ```

   Why 31? We're assuming 32-bit integers here. Adjust if working with different integer sizes.

3. Build Maximum XOR:
   This is the core of our algorithm. We iterate from the MSB position down to the least significant bit, trying to set each bit of our result to 1 if possible.

   Pseudo-code:
   ```
   function buildMaximumXOR(nums, msbPosition):
       result = 0
       prefixMask = 0
       prefixes = new Set()

       for i from msbPosition down to 0:
           prefixMask = prefixMask OR (1 << i)
           candidateResult = result OR (1 << i)
           
           clear prefixes set

           for each num in nums:
               prefix = num AND prefixMask
               if (candidateResult XOR prefix) in prefixes:
                   result = candidateResult
                   break
               add prefix to prefixes

       return result
   ```

Let's break down this core function:

a) We initialize our result to 0 and will build it up bit by bit.

b) The prefixMask is used to extract prefixes of increasing length from our numbers.

c) For each bit position (from left to right):
   - We update our prefixMask to include the current bit.
   - We calculate a candidateResult, which is our current result with the i-th bit set to 1.
   - We clear our set of prefixes for this iteration.
   - For each number in our array:
     * We extract its prefix using the current prefixMask.
     * We check if there exists another prefix in our set that, when XORed with our current prefix, would give us our candidateResult.
     * If such a prefix exists, we know we can achieve a 1 in the current bit position, so we update our result.
     * If not, we add this prefix to our set and continue.

Why does this work?

The key insight is in how XOR behaves. If we have two numbers A and B, and A XOR B = C, then A XOR C = B. We use this property in our algorithm.

At each bit position, we're essentially asking: "Can we find two numbers in our array whose prefixes differ at this position?" If we can, then XORing those two numbers will give us a 1 in that position of our result.

By working from left to right, we ensure that we're always maximizing the most significant bits first, which guarantees we'll find the maximum possible XOR value.

The use of a set for storing prefixes allows us to perform this check efficiently. Instead of comparing each number with every other number, we can check in constant time if the complementary prefix we need exists.

Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity: O(N * M), where N is the number of elements in the array and M is the number of bits in the largest number (32 for standard integers).

- Finding the maximum number: O(N)
- Finding the MSB position: O(1) for 32-bit integers
- Building the maximum XOR:
  * We iterate through M bits
  * For each bit, we iterate through N numbers
  * Set operations (add and contains) are O(1) on average
  * Therefore, this step is O(N * M)

Since M is constant (32) for standard integers, we can simplify this to O(N).

Space Complexity: O(N)

- We use a set to store prefixes, which in the worst case could contain all N numbers.
- Other variables use constant space.

Potential Optimizations:

1. If we know our numbers are within a certain range, we could potentially reduce M, improving performance slightly.

2. For very large arrays with many duplicate numbers, we could consider removing duplicates before processing. This would reduce N but add an O(N log N) sorting step or an O(N) step with a hash set.

Edge Cases and Considerations:

1. Array with a single number: Our algorithm handles this correctly, returning 0 (as the maximum XOR of a number with itself is always 0).

2. Array with all identical numbers: Again, our algorithm naturally returns 0.

3. Numbers with leading zeros: By using a mask and working from the MSB, we handle these correctly without special treatment.

4. Negative numbers: Our approach works with two's complement representation of negative numbers without modification.

Conclusion:

This solution elegantly combines bitwise operations, prefix matching, and set-based lookups to solve what initially appears to be a quadratic-time problem in linear time. By understanding the properties of XOR and working at the bit level, we've developed an algorithm that's both efficient and scalable.

The key takeaways from this approach are:

1. Sometimes, looking at problems from a different perspective (in this case, bitwise operations) can lead to more efficient solutions.

2. Building solutions incrementally (bit by bit in this case) can be powerful, especially when combined with greedy strategies.

3. Clever use of data structures (like sets for constant-time lookups) can dramatically improve algorithm efficiency.

4. Understanding the underlying properties of operations (like XOR) can inspire innovative problem-solving approaches.

This solution not only solves the immediate problem efficiently but also introduces techniques and thought processes that can be applied to a wide range of algorithmic challenges, especially those involving bitwise operations and optimal subset selection.

## Ultimate Detailed Proof for the Maximum XOR Problem

### 1. **Problem Statement and Context**

Given an integer array `nums`, the problem is to find the maximum value of `nums[i] XOR nums[j]`, where `0 ≤ i ≤ j < n`.

#### **Context:**
The XOR operation has significant applications in cryptography, error detection, and network security. Understanding how to maximize XOR between two elements in a set can be crucial in these fields, where bitwise operations are common.

### 2. **Introduction to XOR Operation**

#### **2.1 Definition:**
XOR (exclusive OR) is a bitwise operation. For each bit in the operands:
- The result is `1` if the bits are different.
- The result is `0` if the bits are the same.

#### **2.2 XOR Truth Table:**
| A | B | A ⊕ B |
|---|---|-------|
| 0 | 0 |   0   |
| 0 | 1 |   1   |
| 1 | 0 |   1   |
| 1 | 1 |   0   |

#### **2.3 Key Properties of XOR:**
- **Commutative:** `a ⊕ b = b ⊕ a`
- **Associative:** `(a ⊕ b) ⊕ c = a ⊕ (b ⊕ c)`
- **Identity:** `a ⊕ 0 = a`
- **Self-inverse:** `a ⊕ a = 0`
- **Cancellation:** If `a ⊕ b = c`, then `a ⊕ c = b`

#### **Proof of Cancellation Property:**
Let `a ⊕ b = c`. Then:
```
a ⊕ c = a ⊕ (a ⊕ b)
       = (a ⊕ a) ⊕ b      [by Associative property]
       = 0 ⊕ b            [by Self-inverse property]
       = b                [by Identity property]
```
Thus, `a ⊕ c = b`.

### 3. **Understanding Binary Representation**

#### **3.1 Binary Representation Basics:**
Every non-negative integer can be uniquely represented as a sum of powers of 2. This is known as its binary representation:
$n = \sum_{i=0}^{m} a_i \times 2^i$
Where $a_i$ is the i-th bit (0 or 1) and m is the position of the most significant bit (MSB).

- **Example:** The number `13` in binary is `1101`, which represents $1 \times 2^3 + 1 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 = 13$.

#### **3.2 XOR and Binary Representation:**
When two numbers are XORed, their binary representations are XORed bit by bit:
$(a_3a_2a_1a_0) ⊕ (b_3b_2b_1b_0) = (a_3 ⊕ b_3)(a_2 ⊕ b_2)(a_1 ⊕ b_1)(a_0 ⊕ b_0)$
Where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are the i-th bits of the binary representations of the two numbers.

### 4. **Key Insight for Maximizing XOR**

#### **Lemma:**
To maximize the XOR of two numbers, we should prioritize setting the most significant bits (MSBs) to `1`.

#### **Proof:**
Let $x$ and $y$ be two n-bit numbers, and let $k$ be the position of the leftmost bit where they differ. Consider:
$x = (x_{n-1} \dots x_{k+1} 1 x_{k-1} \dots x_0)$
$y = (y_{n-1} \dots y_{k+1} 0 y_{k-1} \dots y_0)$
Their XOR is:
$x ⊕ y = (0 \dots 0 1 z_{k-1} \dots z_0)$
Where $z_i = x_i ⊕ y_i$.

- **Key Point:** The value of $x ⊕ y$ is at least $2^k$, regardless of the lower bits.
- Therefore, to maximize the XOR, we must ensure the leftmost differing bit is as far left as possible.

### 5. **Prefix Matching**

#### **5.1 Definition:**
A k-bit prefix of a number $n$ is the k most significant bits of $n$’s binary representation.

#### **5.2 Lemma:**
If two numbers have different k-bit prefixes, their XOR will have a `1` in at least the k-th bit position.

#### **Proof:**
Let $a$ and $b$ be two numbers with different k-bit prefixes. There exists $i \leq k$ such that the i-th bit of $a \neq$ i-th bit of $b$. Therefore, the i-th bit of $a ⊕ b = 1$. Since $i \leq k$, the XOR has a `1` in at least the k-th position.

### 6. **The Algorithm's Core Idea**

Our algorithm constructs the maximum XOR value bit by bit, starting from the most significant bit and moving to the least significant bit. At each step, the algorithm attempts to set the current bit to `1` by finding two numbers in the array with differing prefixes up to that bit.

#### **Theorem:**
This greedy approach of setting bits from left to right yields the maximum possible XOR value.

#### **Proof:**
Let $M$ be the maximum XOR value achievable from the array.
Let $R$ be the result produced by our algorithm.

We’ll prove $R = M$ by contradiction.

- **Assume:** $R < M$.
- Let $k$ be the leftmost bit position where $R$ and $M$ differ.
- Since $R < M$, we have:
  $R = (\dots 0 \dots) \text{ (0 in k-th position)}$
  $M = (\dots 1 \dots) \text{ (1 in k-th position)}$
  
- By construction, if the algorithm sets a `0` in the k-th position, it means:
  - For all $a, b$ in the array, the k-bit prefixes of $a$ and $b$ are identical.
  
- But for $M$ to have a `1` in the k-th position, there must exist $x, y$ in the array such that $x ⊕ y$ has a `1` in the k-th position.

This implies $x$ and $y$ have different k-bit prefixes, contradicting our earlier statement.

Thus, our assumption $R < M$ must be false, and we conclude $R = M$.

### 7. **Detailed Explanation of the Algorithm**

Let’s break down the algorithm step by step, ensuring clarity and understanding.

#### **Step 1: Finding the Most Significant Bit (MSB)**

To begin, we need to determine the position of the most significant bit (MSB) in the largest number in the array.

**Lemma:**
The MSB position of the maximum number in the array is the maximum MSB position of any number in the array.

**Proof:**
Let $m$ be the maximum number and $k$ its MSB position.
- For any $n$ in the array, $n \leq m$.
- Therefore, the binary representation of $n$ cannot have a `1` in any position greater than $k$.

To determine the MSB, compute $\lfloor \log_2(\text{max\_num}) \rfloor$, where $\text{max\_num}$ is the largest number in the array.

#### **Step 2: Iterating Over Each Bit Position**

We iterate from the MSB position down to the least significant bit (LSB). At each step, we attempt to set the current bit in the result to `1`.

**Step 2.1: Update the Prefix Mask**
- Initialize a `prefixMask` to zero. This mask helps isolate the prefixes of numbers up to the current bit position.
- For each bit position $i$ from MSB to LSB, update the mask:
  $\text{prefixMask} = \text{prefixMask} | (1 << i)$
  This ensures that the mask covers the bits from the MSB to the current bit.

**Step 2.2: Calculate the Candidate Result**
- At each bit position, assume that the current bit in the final result can be set to `1`:
  $\text{candidateResult} = \text{result} | (1 << i)$

**Step 2.3: Store and Check Prefixes**
- Create an empty set to store the prefixes encountered so far.
- Iterate over each number in the array, applying the `

prefixMask` to extract the prefix:
  $\text{prefix} = \text{num} \& \text{prefixMask}$
  Add the prefix to the set.

**Step 2.4: Validate the Candidate Result**
- For each prefix $p$ in the set, check if $p ⊕ \text{candidateResult}$ is also in the set.
- If such a pair exists, update the result to the candidate result.

**Why This Works:**
If $p ⊕ \text{candidateResult}$ exists in the set, it implies that there are two numbers in the array whose prefixes differ in the current bit position, making it possible to achieve the candidate result.

#### **Step 3: Return the Result**

After iterating through all bit positions, the `result` will hold the maximum XOR value achievable from the array.

### 8. **Time and Space Complexity Analysis**

#### **Time Complexity:**
- **Naive Approach:** $O(N^2)$ - involves checking XOR for every pair of numbers.
- **Optimized Approach:** $O(N \times k)$, where $k$ is the number of bits in the maximum number.
  - **Explanation:** For each of the $k$ bit positions, we perform an $O(N)$ operation to build the prefix set and check for the candidate result.

#### **Space Complexity:**
- The space complexity is $O(N)$ due to the prefix set.

### 9. **Conclusion**

This proof details every aspect of the problem, from the fundamentals of XOR and binary representation to the advanced algorithm used to maximize the XOR value between two numbers in an array. By iterating over each bit position from most significant to least significant, the algorithm ensures that we maximize the XOR by prioritizing higher bit positions. This greedy strategy is not only optimal but also highly efficient compared to the naive approach.
