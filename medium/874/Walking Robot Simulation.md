### Intuition

Overview and Problem Breakdown

The problem presents us with an interesting scenario: a robot navigating an infinite 2D grid, following a series of commands while avoiding obstacles. At its core, this is a simulation problem that combines elements of geometry, data structures, and algorithm design.

Let's break down the key components:

1. Robot State: We need to track the robot's position (x, y coordinates) and orientation (direction it's facing).

2. Command Interpretation: The robot must respond to three types of commands:
   - Turn left 90 degrees (-2)
   - Turn right 90 degrees (-1)
   - Move forward 1 to 9 units (positive integers)

3. Obstacle Avoidance: The robot must stop before hitting any obstacles.

4. Distance Tracking: We need to calculate and keep track of the maximum Euclidean distance squared from the origin.

The constraints given in the problem statement are crucial for understanding the scale we're dealing with:

- Up to 10,000 commands
- Up to 10,000 obstacles
- Coordinate range: -30,000 to 30,000

These constraints hint that we need an efficient solution, likely with O(n) time complexity where n is the total number of commands and obstacles.

An important note that deserves attention is the clarification about obstacles at [0,0]. The problem statement mentions that there can be an obstacle at [0,0], but it's not entirely clear how this should be handled. Your interpretation that "the robot can move away but not return to that point" is a reasonable one. This ambiguity highlights the importance of clarifying requirements in real-world problem-solving scenarios. The key is to break down the problem into its core elements and think about how we'd solve it intuitively.

1. Modeling the Robot

The first "aha" moment comes when we realize that this problem is essentially about simulating a robot's behavior. In real life, a robot would have:

- A current position
- A direction it's facing
- The ability to turn
- The ability to move forward

This realization naturally leads us to think about creating a 'Robot' entity that encapsulates these properties and behaviors. It's not about the code implementation yet, but about recognizing that we're dealing with a self-contained unit that has its own state and actions.

2. Representing Direction

Next, we need to think about how to represent the robot's direction. Intuitively, we know the robot can face four directions: North, East, South, and West. But how can we represent this mathematically?

Here's where a key insight comes in: these four directions form a cycle. If we keep turning right, we go from North to East to South to West and back to North. This cyclic nature hints at using modular arithmetic.

If we assign numbers to these directions (say, 0 for North, 1 for East, 2 for South, 3 for West), we can model turning as simple addition:

- Turn right: Add 1 and wrap around at 4
- Turn left: Subtract 1 (or add 3, which is the same in modular arithmetic) and wrap around at 4

This representation makes turning operations remarkably simple and intuitive.

3. Handling Movement

When it comes to movement, our intuition tells us that the robot should move one step at a time, even if the command is to move multiple steps. Why? Because we need to check for obstacles after each step.

This step-by-step movement mimics how a real robot would behave: move a bit, check surroundings, move again if clear. It's a more cautious and realistic approach than trying to make one big leap and then backtracking if an obstacle is encountered.

4. Dealing with Obstacles

The obstacle challenge is where we need to think creatively. We know we'll be checking for obstacles frequently - potentially at every step the robot takes. This frequent checking is a clue that we need a very fast way to determine if a position contains an obstacle.

What's the fastest way to check if something exists in a collection? Hash-based lookups come to mind. If we can somehow convert each obstacle position into a unique identifier and store these in a hash set, we can achieve near-constant time lookups.

This is a crucial insight because it dramatically improves the efficiency of our solution, especially when dealing with a large number of obstacles.

5. Tracking Maximum Distance

The problem asks for the maximum distance reached, not the final position. This tells us we need to continuously track the "high score" of our robot's journey.

An intuitive way to think about this is imagining a stretch band connected from the origin to the robot. As the robot moves, this band stretches and contracts. We're interested in the moment when this band is stretched the furthest.

6. Squared Distance: A Mathematical Insight

The problem specifically asks for the squared Euclidean distance. This is more than just a quirk of the problem statement - it's a valuable optimization hint.

Calculating actual Euclidean distances involves square roots, which are computationally expensive and can lead to precision errors with floating-point numbers. By working with squared distances, we avoid these issues entirely.

Moreover, the square function is monotonically increasing for positive numbers, which means the largest squared distance will correspond to the largest actual distance. This allows us to find the maximum without ever calculating an actual Euclidean distance.

7. Handling Edge Cases

As we think through the problem, we should consider potential edge cases:

- What if the robot starts on an obstacle?
- What if all commands are turns and no moves?
- What if the robot gets "trapped" by obstacles?

Our step-by-step simulation approach naturally handles most of these cases, but it's important to think them through to ensure our solution is robust.

The Elegance of Simulation

Ultimately, the intuition behind this approach is to create a faithful simulation of the robot's behavior. By modeling the robot's properties and actions closely to how a real robot would behave, we create a solution that's not only correct but also intuitive and extensible.

This simulation-based approach has an elegant simplicity to it. Rather than trying to optimize the path or predict the outcome, we simply follow the commands one by one, just as a real robot would. This makes our solution easy to understand, verify, and potentially extend with new features in the future.

In essence, the key to this problem isn't finding a clever algorithmic trick, but rather in recognizing that a straightforward, true-to-life simulation, combined with efficient data structures, can lead to a solution that's both intuitive and performant.

### Approach 


Robot Navigation Problem: A Comprehensive Approach

1. Problem Overview

We're tasked with simulating a robot's movement on an infinite 2D grid. The robot starts at the origin (0, 0) facing north and must execute a series of commands while avoiding obstacles. Our goal is to find the maximum squared Euclidean distance the robot reaches from the origin during its journey.

2. Core Components of the Solution

Our solution revolves around three main components:

a) Robot: Represents the robot's state and behavior.
b) Obstacle: Represents obstacles on the grid.
c) Solution: Orchestrates the simulation and calculates the result.

Let's dive into each component and explore the logic behind them.

3. The Robot Component

The Robot is the central entity in our simulation. It encapsulates the robot's state and behavior.

Pseudo-code for the Robot:

```
class Robot:
    properties:
        x: integer  // current x-coordinate
        y: integer  // current y-coordinate
        dir: integer  // current direction (0: North, 1: East, 2: South, 3: West)
        maxDistance: integer  // maximum squared distance reached

    method initialize():
        x = 0
        y = 0
        dir = 0
        maxDistance = 0

    method handleCommand(command: integer, obstacles: Set of Obstacle):
        if command == -2:  // Turn left
            dir = (dir + 3) % 4
        else if command == -1:  // Turn right
            dir = (dir + 1) % 4
        else:  // Move forward
            for i from 1 to command:
                newX = x
                newY = y
                if dir == 0:  // Facing North
                    newY = y + 1
                else if dir == 1:  // Facing East
                    newX = x + 1
                else if dir == 2:  // Facing South
                    newY = y - 1
                else:  // Facing West
                    newX = x - 1
                
                if not obstacles.contains(Obstacle(newX, newY)):
                    x = newX
                    y = newY
                    maxDistance = max(maxDistance, x * x + y * y)
                else:
                    break  // Stop at obstacle
```

Let's break down the key aspects of the Robot:

a) State Representation:
   - The robot's position is represented by (x, y) coordinates.
   - The direction is represented by an integer (0-3) corresponding to North, East, South, and West.
   - maxDistance keeps track of the maximum squared distance reached.

b) Direction Handling:
   We use modular arithmetic to handle direction changes efficiently. This approach leverages the cyclic nature of directions:
   - Turning right: (dir + 1) % 4
   - Turning left: (dir + 3) % 4 (equivalent to subtracting 1 and wrapping around)

   This method is both intuitive and computationally efficient, avoiding complex if-else structures.

c) Movement Simulation:
   The robot moves one step at a time, even for multi-step commands. This granular approach allows for accurate obstacle detection and mimics real-world robot behavior.

d) Obstacle Checking:
   Before each step, we check if the new position contains an obstacle. This cautious approach ensures the robot never illegally occupies an obstacle's position.

e) Distance Tracking:
   After each successful move, we update the maxDistance if necessary. We use the squared Euclidean distance (xÂ² + yÂ²) to avoid costly square root calculations and potential floating-point precision issues.

4. The Obstacle Component

The Obstacle component represents barriers on the grid that the robot must avoid.

Pseudo-code for the Obstacle:

```
class Obstacle:
    properties:
        x: integer
        y: integer

    method initialize(x: integer, y: integer):
        this.x = x
        this.y = y

    method equals(other: Object) -> boolean:
        if other is not Obstacle:
            return false
        return this.x == other.x and this.y == other.y

    method hashCode() -> integer:
        return x + y * LARGE_PRIME
```

Key points about the Obstacle:

a) Representation:
   Each obstacle is simply represented by its (x, y) coordinates on the grid.

b) Equality:
   Two obstacles are considered equal if they have the same x and y coordinates. This is crucial for the correct functioning of the hash set we'll use to store obstacles.

c) Hashing:
   The hashCode method creates a unique identifier for each obstacle. We use a simple but effective hashing function:
   hash = x + y * LARGE_PRIME
   Where LARGE_PRIME is a prime number larger than the maximum possible coordinate value (in this case, larger than 30,000).

   This hashing function has several advantageous properties:
   - It's simple and fast to compute.
   - It produces unique values for all possible obstacle positions within the problem constraints.
   - It allows for efficient lookup in our hash set of obstacles.

5. The Solution Component

The Solution component orchestrates the entire simulation process.

Pseudo-code for the Solution:

```
class Solution:
    method robotSim(commands: array of integer, obstacles: array of array of integer) -> integer:
        robot = new Robot()
        obstacleSet = new HashSet of Obstacle

        for each obs in obstacles:
            obstacleSet.add(new Obstacle(obs[0], obs[1]))

        for each cmd in commands:
            robot.handleCommand(cmd, obstacleSet)

        return robot.maxDistance
```

Let's analyze the key aspects of this solution:

a) Obstacle Preprocessing:
   We convert the array of obstacle coordinates into a HashSet of Obstacle objects. This preprocessing step is crucial for efficient obstacle checking during the robot's movement.

   Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of obstacles
   Space Complexity: O(n) to store the obstacles in the hash set

   The use of a hash set allows for near-constant time lookups when checking for obstacles, which is a critical operation that occurs frequently during the simulation.

b) Command Execution:
   We iterate through each command, calling the robot's handleCommand method for each. This approach allows us to simulate the robot's journey step by step.

   Time Complexity: O(m * k), where m is the number of commands and k is the maximum value of any move command (1 â¤ k â¤ 9)

c) Overall Complexity:
   Time Complexity: O(n + m * k), where n is the number of obstacles, m is the number of commands, and k is the maximum value of any move command.
   Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the obstacles in the hash set.

6. Mathematical Insights

a) Squared Euclidean Distance:
   The problem asks for the maximum squared Euclidean distance. This is more than just a quirk of the problem statement; it's a valuable optimization hint.

   The squared Euclidean distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is:
   dÂ² = (x2 - x1)Â² + (y2 - y1)Â²

   In our case, since we're always measuring from the origin (0, 0), this simplifies to:
   dÂ² = xÂ² + yÂ²

   Working with squared distances offers several advantages:
   - It avoids computationally expensive square root calculations.
   - It eliminates potential floating-point precision errors.
   - It preserves the order relationship between distances (if a > b, then aÂ² > bÂ²), allowing us to find the maximum distance without ever calculating actual Euclidean distances.

b) Modular Arithmetic for Directions:
   Our use of modular arithmetic to handle direction changes is both elegant and efficient. It leverages the cyclic nature of the four cardinal directions:

   (current_direction + turn) % 4

   Where turn is 1 for right turns and 3 (equivalent to -1 in modulo 4) for left turns.

   This approach eliminates the need for complex conditional logic and naturally handles the wraparound from West (3) back to North (0).

7. Edge Cases and Considerations

Our solution naturally handles several edge cases:

a) Starting on an Obstacle:
   If there's an obstacle at (0, 0), the robot can move away from it but can't return. This is handled by our step-by-step movement simulation and obstacle checking.

b) All Turn Commands:
   If all commands are turns with no movement, the maxDistance will remain 0, which is correct.

c) Robot Gets Trapped:
   If the robot becomes surrounded by obstacles, it will simply stop moving. The maxDistance will reflect the furthest point reached before being trapped.

d) Large Number of Obstacles:
   Our use of a hash set for obstacle storage and lookup ensures efficient performance even with the maximum allowed number of obstacles (10,000).

e) Coordinate Range:
   The problem constrains coordinates to the range [-30000, 30000]. Our solution works correctly within this range, and the use of squared distances ensures we won't exceed the integer limit for the result.

8. Conclusion

This solution elegantly combines several key concepts:
- Object-oriented design to model the robot and obstacles
- Efficient data structures (hash set) for obstacle management
- Mathematical insights (modular arithmetic, squared distances) for optimized calculations
- Step-by-step simulation for accurate behavior modeling

The result is a solution that is not only correct and efficient but also intuitive and extensible. It closely models how a real robot would navigate a complex environment, making the code easy to understand, verify, and potentially extend with new features.

By breaking down the problem into manageable components (Robot, Obstacle, Solution) and addressing key concerns (efficient obstacle detection, accurate movement simulation), we've developed a solution that scales well with large inputs and handles various edge cases.

This approach demonstrates that sometimes, the best solution comes not from trying to outsmart the problem with complex algorithms, but from faithfully representing its nature through careful modeling and efficient data management.
