# Approach 1 Recursion
### Intuition
When we first look at this problem, we might think about how we'd actually create multiple 'A's on a notepad. We start with one 'A', and we have two choices: we can either copy what we have and then paste it, or we can just paste what we copied before.

The tricky part is figuring out when to copy and when to paste. If we just keep pasting, we'll only add the same number of 'A's each time. But if we copy too often, we might be wasting operations.

The key insight is that we don't need to copy every single time. Once we've copied, we can paste that same thing multiple times. For example, if we want 9 'A's, we could do this:

1. Start with 'A'
2. Copy All (now we have 'A' in the clipboard)
3. Paste (now we have 'AA')
4. Copy All (now we have 'AA' in the clipboard)
5. Paste (now we have 'AAAA')
6. Paste (now we have 'AAAAAA')
7. Copy All (now we have 'AAAAAA' in the clipboard)
8. Paste (now we have 'AAAAAAAAAAAA')

See that We overshot. But this shows us that we need to be smart about when we copy and when we paste.

This suggests that we might need to try different combinations of copying and pasting to find the best one. And that's where the idea of using recursion comes in.

### Approach

**Mathematical Explanation**

Let's define our function $f(i, j$) more formally:

$f(i, j)$ = the minimum number of operations needed to get n A's, starting with i A's on the screen and j A's in the clipboard.

Our goal is to find $f(1, 1)$, which represents starting with one 'A' on the screen and one 'A' in the clipboard.

At each step, we have two options:

1. Copy All and Paste:
   This operation always takes 2 steps (1 for Copy, 1 for Paste).
   It changes our state from $(i, j)$ to $(2i, i)$.
   The number of operations for this choice is: 2 + $f(2i, i)$

2. Paste Only:
   This operation takes 1 step.
   It changes our state from $(i, j)$ to $(i+j, j)$.
   The number of operations for this choice is: 1 + $f(i+j, j)$

Therefore, we can express $f(i, j)$ as a recurrence relation:

$f(i, j) = min(2 + f(2i, i), 1 + f(i+j, j))$

This recurrence relation captures the essence of our decision at each step: we're choosing the minimum between the two possible operations.

Base cases:
1. If i = n, we've reached our goal, so $f(n, j)$ = 0 for any j.
2. If i > n, we've overshot, so we return a very large number (effectively infinity).

Now, let's look at how this plays out mathematically for a few steps:

Starting state: (1, 1)
$f(1, 1) = min(2 + f(2, 1), 1 + f(2, 1))$
        = 1 + $f(2, 1)$  // Paste is always better when $i=j$

Now for $f(2, 1)$:
$f(2, 1) = min(2 + f(4, 2), 1 + f(3, 1))$

For $f(4, 2)$:
$f(4, 2) = min(2 + f(8, 4), 1 + f(6, 2))$

For $f(3, 1)$:
$f(3, 1) = min(2 + f(6, 3), 1 + f(4, 1))$

This process continues, building a tree of recursive calls, until we reach our base cases.

The key mathematical insight is that this process will always terminate because:
1. Each "Copy All and Paste" operation doubles the number of A's.
2. Each "Paste" operation increases the number of A's by at least 1.

Therefore, we will always eventually either reach n or overshoot n.

The solution is found by always choosing the minimum at each step, which ensures we explore all possible combinations of operations while keeping track of the best (minimum) solution found so far.

**Implementation**

1. We start with a function that takes two parameters:
   - `currentLength`: The number of 'A's we currently have on the screen
   - `clipboardLength`: The number of 'A's we have copied to our clipboard

2. Our goal is to reach exactly `targetLength` 'A's using the minimum number of operations.

3. At each step, we have two choices:
   - Copy All and then Paste
   - Just Paste

4. We use recursion to explore both of these choices at each step.

5. We keep track of the minimum number of operations needed to reach our target.

Here's a detailed pseudo-code representation of our approach:

```
function minSteps(targetLength):
    if targetLength == 1:
        return 0  // We already have one 'A', so no operations needed
    
    return 1 + findMinSteps(1, 1)  // Start with one 'A' on screen and in clipboard

function findMinSteps(currentLength, clipboardLength):
    if currentLength == targetLength:
        return 0  // We've reached our goal, no more operations needed
    
    if currentLength > targetLength:
        return VERY_LARGE_NUMBER  // We've overshot, this path is invalid
    
    // Try Copy All and Paste
    copyAndPaste = 2 + findMinSteps(currentLength * 2, currentLength)
    
    // Try Paste only
    pasteOnly = 1 + findMinSteps(currentLength + clipboardLength, clipboardLength)
    
    // Return the minimum of the two options
    return minimum(copyAndPaste, pasteOnly)
```

Now, let's dive deeper into each part of this approach:

1. Base Cases:
   - If `currentLength == targetLength`, we've reached our goal. We return 0 because no more operations are needed.
   - If `currentLength > targetLength`, we've overshot our goal. This path is invalid, so we return a very large number to ensure this path isn't chosen.

2. Recursive Cases:
   We explore two options at each step:

   a. Copy All and Paste:
      - This takes 2 operations (1 for Copy All, 1 for Paste)
      - It doubles our current length
      - The clipboard now contains our current length
      - We recursively call our function with these new values

   b. Paste Only:
      - This takes 1 operation
      - It adds our clipboard length to our current length
      - The clipboard length stays the same
      - We recursively call our function with these new values

3. Choosing the Best Option:
   After exploring both options, we return the minimum of the two. This ensures we're always choosing the path with the fewest operations.

4. Initial Call:
   We start our process with 1 'A' on the screen and 1 'A' in the clipboard. That's why our initial call is `findMinSteps(1, 1)`.

5. Handling the n=1 Case:
   If `n` is 1, we already have the desired result (one 'A'), so we return 0.

This recursive approach essentially builds a tree of all possible combinations of Copy All and Paste operations. At each node in this tree, we're making a decision: should we copy and paste, or just paste? By exploring all paths and always choosing the minimum, we guarantee that we'll find the optimal solution.


### Complexity
- **Time complexity: $O(2^n)$**
  In the worst case, we might explore every possible combination of Copy All and Paste operations. At each step, we make two recursive calls, which leads to a binary tree of recursive calls. The depth of this tree could be up to n in the worst case. This gives us a time complexity of O(2^n).
It's worth noting that while the time complexity looks bad, the actual running time for the constraints given (n <= 1000) is manageable because many recursive calls will end early due to overshooting the target length. However, for larger values of n, we'd need to consider more efficient approaches, such as dynamic programming.

- **Space complexity: $O(n)$**
  The space complexity is determined by the maximum depth of the recursion stack. In the worst case, this depth could be n, giving us a space complexity of O(n).

    private int targetLength;

# Approach 2


### Intuition

When we first encounter this problem, we might think about how we'd manually create multiple 'A's on a notepad. We start with a single 'A', and we have two choices: we can either copy what we have and then paste it, or we can just paste what we copied before.

The challenge lies in determining when to copy and when to paste. If we just keep pasting, we'll only add the same number of 'A's each time. But if we copy too often, we might be wasting operations. This suggests that there's a balance to strike, and finding that balance is key to minimizing our operations.

Let's consider an example. Suppose we want to get 9 'A's. We might do something like this:

1. Start with 'A'
2. Copy All (clipboard: 'A')
3. Paste (now we have 'AA')
4. Copy All (clipboard: 'AA')
5. Paste (now we have 'AAAA')
6. Paste (now we have 'AAAAAA')
7. Copy All (clipboard: 'AAAAAA')
8. Paste (now we have 'AAAAAAAAAAAA')

We've overshot our target, but this illustrates an important point: we don't need to copy every single time. Once we've copied, we can paste that same thing multiple times.

This realization leads us to think recursively. At each step, we have two choices:

1. Copy all and then paste
2. Just paste what's already in the clipboard

We need to try both these options and see which one leads to the target with fewer operations.

Here's where it gets interesting. As we explore these options recursively, we'll notice that we're solving the same subproblems over and over. For instance, whether we get to 4 'A's by copying and pasting 'AA' or by pasting 'A' four times, the question "what's the best way to get from 4 'A's to the target?" is the same.

This observation is crucial. It tells us that our problem has overlapping subproblems, a key characteristic of problems that can be optimized using dynamic programming.

The idea of dynamic programming is to break down a complex problem into simpler subproblems, solve each subproblem only once, and store their solutions for future use. In our case, each subproblem is "what's the minimum number of operations to get from X 'A's to the target, given that I have Y 'A's in my clipboard?"

By storing the solutions to these subproblems (a technique called memoization), we can avoid redundant calculations and significantly speed up our algorithm.

This top-down approach allows us to maintain the intuitive recursive structure of our solution while dramatically improving its efficiency. We're essentially building a solution from the top (our target) down to the base cases, but we're smart about it - we remember what we've calculated so we don't have to calculate it again.

This approach mimics how we might think about the problem naturally (recursively trying different options), but it optimizes this process by eliminating redundant work. It's a perfect blend of intuitive problem-solving and algorithmic efficiency.

### Approach
Let's dive deep into the approach, breaking it down step by step:

1. **Problem State Representation**

   We represent each state in our problem with two key pieces of information:
   - `currentLength`: The number of 'A's we currently have on the screen
   - `clipboardLength`: The number of 'A's we have copied to our clipboard

   Why these two? Because they completely describe our current situation. With these two pieces of information, we know exactly what our options are: we can either paste `clipboardLength` 'A's, or we can copy all and then paste, doubling our `currentLength`.

2. **Base Cases**

   We define two important base cases:
   
   a. If `currentLength == targetLength`, we return 0. This means we've reached our goal, and no more operations are needed.
   
   b. If `currentLength > targetLength`, we return a very large number (effectively infinity). This indicates that we've overshot our target, and this path is invalid.

   These base cases are crucial as they define when our recursion should stop and start returning values back up the call stack.

3. **Memoization Setup**

   We create a 2D array `cache` to store our memoized results:
   - The first dimension represents `currentLength` (from 0 to targetLength)
   - The second dimension represents `clipboardLength` (from 0 to targetLength/2)

   We use targetLength/2 for the second dimension because our clipboard length will never exceed half of our target length. (If it did, a single paste would overshoot our target.)

   We initialize this array with a sentinel value (like -1) to indicate uncalculated states.

4. **Main Recursive Function**

   Our core function, let's call it `calculateMinOps`, takes two parameters: `currentLength` and `clipboardLength`.

   Here's a detailed breakdown of this function:

   ```
   function calculateMinOps(currentLength, clipboardLength):
       // Base cases
       if currentLength == targetLength:
           return 0
       if currentLength > targetLength:
           return VERY_LARGE_NUMBER

       // Check memoized result
       if cache[currentLength][clipboardLength] is not sentinel:
           return cache[currentLength][clipboardLength]

       // Option 1: Paste
       pasteOption = 1 + calculateMinOps(currentLength + clipboardLength, clipboardLength)

       // Option 2: Copy All and Paste
       copyPasteOption = 2 + calculateMinOps(currentLength * 2, currentLength)

       // Choose the better option
       result = min(pasteOption, copyPasteOption)

       // Memoize the result
       cache[currentLength][clipboardLength] = result

       return result
   ```

   Let's break this down further:

   a. We first check our base cases. This is crucial for stopping our recursion.

   b. We then check if we've already calculated the result for this state. If so, we return the memoized result immediately. This is the key to our optimization.

   c. If we haven't calculated this state before, we explore our two options:
      - Paste: We add `clipboardLength` to our `currentLength` and make a recursive call. This costs 1 operation.
      - Copy and Paste: We double our `currentLength` and update our `clipboardLength`. This costs 2 operations (1 for copy, 1 for paste).

   d. We take the minimum of these two options. This ensures we're always choosing the path with fewer operations.

   e. Before returning, we store our result in the cache. This is crucial for our memoization strategy.

5. **Initial Call**

   We start our process with `calculateMinOps(1, 1)`. This represents our initial state: one 'A' on the screen, and one 'A' in the clipboard.

6. **Recursion and Memoization in Action**

   As our function runs, it will build up solutions to subproblems and store them in the cache. For example, it might calculate the best way to get from 2 'A's to the target, then later reuse that result when it encounters the same subproblem through a different path.

7. **Result Interpretation**

   The value returned by our initial call to `calculateMinOps(1, 1)` is the minimum number of operations needed to reach the target length from our starting state of one 'A'.

This approach combines the intuitive nature of recursion with the efficiency of dynamic programming. We're essentially building a solution from the top (our target) down to the base cases, but we're being smart about it by remembering what we've calculated to avoid redundant work.

The use of memoization transforms what would otherwise be an exponential time algorithm into a polynomial one. We're trading space (in the form of our cache) for time, which is often a worthwhile trade-off.

This method also has the advantage of being relatively easy to understand and implement, while still being highly efficient. It closely mirrors how we might think about the problem naturally, making it a great example of how algorithmic thinking can optimize our intuitive problem-solving processes.


### Complexity
- **Time complexity: $O(n^2)$**
In the worst case, we might need to fill out our entire cache. The cache has dimensions n × (n/2), where n is our target length. For each cell, we're doing constant time operations. Therefore, our time complexity is O(n * n/2) = O(n^2).
- **Space complexity: $O(n^2)$**
Our cache is a 2D array with dimensions n × (n/2), so our space complexity is also O(n^2). Additionally, the recursion itself will use stack space, but this will be at most O(n) deep, which is dominated by the O(n^2) space of our cache.

    private int targetLength;

# Apporach 3 Bottom up dynamic approach
### Intuition

When we first tackled this problem using recursion, we explored the idea of making choices between copying and pasting to reach our target number of 'A's. We realized that the key was finding the right balance between these operations to minimize our steps.

Our recursive solution tried all possible combinations, which led us to a top-down dynamic programming approach. We used memoization to avoid recalculating subproblems, storing results for each unique state of current length and clipboard length.

Now, let's shift our perspective to a bottom-up approach. Instead of starting from our target and working backwards, we'll build our solution from the ground up. This feels more natural, like actually writing 'A's on a notepad, starting with one and figuring out the most efficient way to reach our goal.

The core insight remains the same: at any point, we can either paste what we've copied before, or we can copy everything we have and then paste. But instead of making these decisions recursively, we'll systematically build up our solution for all possible numbers of 'A's from 1 to our target.

Think of it like filling out a table. For each number of 'A's, we'll calculate the minimum number of steps to reach that many 'A's. To do this, we'll consider all the ways we could have gotten there by copying and pasting from a smaller number of 'A's.

This bottom-up approach eliminates the need for recursive calls and explicit memoization. Instead, we're directly building our solution in an iterative manner, which can be more efficient and easier to reason about.

Let's consider the mathematical relationship between these subproblems. For any number i of 'A's, the last operation must have been a paste. The number of 'A's we pasted must be a factor of i. For instance, if we have 12 'A's, the last paste could have been 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 'A's.

So, to reach i 'A's, we could have:
1. Started with j 'A's (where j is a factor of i)
2. Performed a Copy All operation
3. Pasted (i/j - 1) times

The total number of operations in this scenario would be:
f(j) + 1 + (i/j - 1) = f(j) + i/j
we add 1 (for the Copy All operation) and then subtract 1 from i/j (because we've already accounted for one paste in the Copy All step)

Here, f(j) is the minimum operations to reach j 'A's, 1 accounts for the Copy All operation, and i/j - 1 represents the number of Paste operations.

Therefore, we can express f(i) in terms of f(j) for all factors j of i:

f(i) = min(f(j) + i/j) for all j where i mod j == 0

This relationship forms the basis of our bottom-up dynamic programming approach. However, our implementation improves upon this by recognizing that we don't need to check all factors up to i/2. Instead, we can optimize by only checking up to the square root of i.



### Approach

Let's break it down:

1. **Initialize our DP array:**

   ```pseudo
   function minSteps(targetCount):
       if targetCount == 1:
           return 0
       minOperations = new array of size (targetCount + 1)
       fill minOperations with a large value (e.g., Integer.MAX_VALUE)
       minOperations[1] = 0  // Base case: It takes 0 steps to have 1 'A'
   ```

   We start by handling the base case. If the target is 1 'A', we need 0 operations. For all other cases, we create an array `minOperations` to store our subproblem solutions. We initialize all values to a large number because we're looking for the minimum number of operations, and we'll be using min() operations later.

   The array is sized targetCount + 1 because we want to use 1-based indexing for clarity - minOperations[i] will represent the minimum operations to get i 'A's.

   We set minOperations[1] = 0 as our base case, representing that it takes 0 operations to have 1 'A' (our starting point).

2. **Build our solution iteratively:**

   ```pseudo
   for currentCount from 2 to targetCount:
       for factor from 1 to sqrt(currentCount):
           if currentCount is divisible by factor:
               // Consider reaching currentCount by copying 'factor' A's
               // and then pasting (currentCount / factor - 1) times
               minOperations[currentCount] = min(minOperations[currentCount], 
                                                 minOperations[factor] + currentCount / factor)
               
               // Consider the complementary factor
               if factor != currentCount / factor:
                   minOperations[currentCount] = min(minOperations[currentCount], 
                                                     minOperations[currentCount / factor] + factor)
   ```

    We iterate from 2 to targetCount because we've already handled the base case of 1. For each number of 'A's (currentCount), we need to determine the minimum number of operations to reach it.

   The key insight is that we can reach currentCount 'A's by copying some smaller number of 'A's and then pasting it multiple times. But which smaller number should we copy? It must be a factor of currentCount.

   Why factors? Because if we copy x 'A's and paste it y times, we'll end up with x * (y+1) 'A's. For this to equal currentCount, x must be a factor of currentCount.

   Now, let's break down the inner loop:

   a. `for factor from 1 to sqrt(currentCount)`:
      We only need to check factors up to the square root of currentCount. This is a crucial optimization. Why? Because factors come in pairs. If a * b = currentCount, then either a ≤ √currentCount or b ≤ √currentCount (or both, if a = b = √currentCount).

   b. `if currentCount is divisible by factor`:
      This check ensures that factor is indeed a factor of currentCount.

   c. `minOperations[currentCount] = min(minOperations[currentCount], minOperations[factor] + currentCount / factor)`:
      This is where we calculate one possible way to reach currentCount 'A's:
      - Start with factor 'A's (which takes minOperations[factor] operations)
      - Copy these factor 'A's (1 operation, implicitly included in currentCount / factor)
      - Paste (currentCount / factor - 1) times to reach currentCount 'A's
      
      The total operations is thus minOperations[factor] + currentCount / factor.
      We use min() to keep the smallest number of operations found so far.

   d. `if factor != currentCount / factor`:
      This check is to handle the complementary factor. If factor * factor != currentCount, then currentCount / factor is also a factor of currentCount, and we need to consider it too.

   e. `minOperations[currentCount] = min(minOperations[currentCount], minOperations[currentCount / factor] + factor)`:
      This is similar to step c, but considering the complementary factor:
      - Start with (currentCount / factor) 'A's (takes minOperations[currentCount / factor] operations)
      - Copy these 'A's (1 operation, implicitly included in factor)
      - Paste (factor - 1) times to reach currentCount 'A's
      
      The total operations is minOperations[currentCount / factor] + factor.

   By considering both factor and currentCount / factor in each iteration, we ensure we've looked at all possible factor pairs without explicitly iterating through all of them.

3. **Return the final result:**

   ```pseudo
   return minOperations[targetCount]
   ```

   After we've iterated through all numbers from 2 to targetCount, minOperations[targetCount] will contain the minimum number of operations needed to reach targetCount 'A's. This is our final answer.

This approach systematically builds up our solution, considering all efficient ways to reach each number of 'A's. For each number, we consider all ways to reach it by copying and pasting from smaller numbers, always keeping track of the minimum number of operations needed.


1. We solve each subproblem only once and use those solutions to build up to larger problems.
2. By considering factors, we drastically reduce the number of possibilities we need to check for each number.
3. By only checking up to the square root, we further optimize our search while still considering all possibilities.
4. We implicitly handle all copy-paste patterns: copying early and pasting many times, or copying later and pasting fewer times.



Pseudo-code

```pseudo
function minSteps(targetCount):
    if targetCount == 1:
        return 0
    
    minOperations = new array of size (targetCount + 1)
    fill minOperations with a large value (e.g., Integer.MAX_VALUE)
    minOperations[1] = 0

    for currentCount from 2 to targetCount:
        for factor from 1 to sqrt(currentCount):
            if currentCount is divisible by factor:
                minOperations[currentCount] = min(minOperations[currentCount], 
                                                  minOperations[factor] + currentCount / factor)
                
                if factor != currentCount / factor:
                    minOperations[currentCount] = min(minOperations[currentCount], 
                                                      minOperations[currentCount / factor] + factor)

    return minOperations[targetCount]
```

This approach systematically builds up our solution, considering all efficient ways to reach each number of 'A's. By the time we reach our target, we've explored all possibilities and found the minimum number of steps.

The key improvements in our approach are:
1. We reduce the search space by only checking factors up to the square root.
2. We implicitly consider all factor pairs in a single pass.
3. We build our solution iteratively, avoiding the overhead of recursive function calls.



### Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n * sqrt(n))
  For each number from 2 to n, we iterate up to its square root. This gives us a time complexity of O(n * sqrt(n)).

- Space complexity: O(n)
  We use a DP array of size n+1 to store our intermediate results.

This optimized bottom-up approach significantly improves upon both the time complexity of the original recursive solution (which was exponential) and the space complexity of the top-down memoized approach (which required a 2D array). It strikes an excellent balance between efficiency and understandability.

### Complexity
- **Time complexity: $O(n * sqrt(n))$**
  For each number from 2 to n, we iterate up to its square root. This gives us a time complexity of O(n * sqrt(n)).

- **Space complexity: $O(n)$**
  We use a DP array of size n+1 to store our intermediate results.

# Approach 4 Prime Factorization
### Intuition
Okay, so we've been thinking about this problem of getting 'A's on a screen using Copy All and Paste operations. We started with recursive approaches, then moved to dynamic programming to avoid repeating work. But there's an even cleverer way to think about this.

Remember how we realized that the most efficient way to get a bunch of 'A's is to do a Copy All, then a bunch of Pastes, then maybe another Copy All, more Pastes, and so on? Well, what if we could figure out the perfect places to do those Copy Alls?

Here's the key insight: the best places to do Copy Alls are when you've got a number of 'A's that divides evenly into your final goal. And not just any number - the smallest such number each time. Why? Because that lets you build up to your goal most efficiently.

Now, think about what numbers divide evenly into your goal. They're the factors of that number, right? And what are the smallest factors of any number? Its prime factors!

So here's the big idea: if we can break our goal number down into its prime factors, that'll tell us exactly how to build up our 'A's most efficiently. Each prime factor represents a round of Copy All followed by some Pastes. And the sum of all these prime factors? That's our total number of operations!


### Approach

Imagine you're playing a game where you need to write the letter 'A' on a piece of paper many times. You start with one 'A', and you have two special moves:

1. Copy: You can copy all the 'A's you've written so far.
2. Paste: You can paste what you've copied.

Your goal is to write a specific number of 'A's using the fewest moves possible.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Building 'A's: 
   Think about how you'd do this. You might write 'A', then copy it, paste it once (now you have 'AA'), then copy those two, paste them twice (now you have 'AAAA'), and so on.

2. Grouping Moves: 
   We can group these moves. Each group starts with a Copy and ends with some number of Pastes. For example:
   - [Copy, Paste] gives you 2 'A's
   - [Copy, Paste, Paste] gives you 3 'A's
   - [Copy, Paste, Paste, Paste] gives you 4 'A's

3. Counting Moves: 
   In each group, the number of moves is the same as the number of 'A's you end up with. For example, [Copy, Paste, Paste] is 3 moves and gives you 3 'A's.

4. The Puzzle: 
   Our job is to find the best way to group these moves to get the exact number of 'A's we want, using the fewest total moves.

5. A Key Discovery: 
   Here's something cool: If a group is too big, we can often save moves by splitting it. For example, instead of [Copy, Paste, Paste, Paste, Paste, Paste] (6 moves), we can do [Copy, Paste, Paste][Copy, Paste] (5 moves). Both give us 6 'A's, but the second way uses fewer moves!

6. The Big Idea: 
   It turns out that the best way to group our moves always matches up with something called "prime factors" in math. Prime factors are like the building blocks of numbers.

7. The Solution: 
   So, our game of writing 'A's turns into a math puzzle: find the prime factors of the number of 'A's we want, and add them up. That sum tells us the fewest moves we need!

This is why our solution looks at the factors of the number we're given. Each factor represents a group of moves, and by finding the smallest factors (the prime ones), we're finding the most efficient way to write our 'A's.

It's like discovering that this game of writing letters is secretly a math puzzle in disguise!

Now that we understand the deep mathematical underpinnings of this problem, let's develop our approach:

**1. Prime Factorization:**
   Our core task is to find the prime factors of n. We'll do this by iteratively dividing n by prime numbers.

**2. Iterative Division:**
   We'll start with the smallest prime number, 2, and keep dividing n by it as long as we can. Each time we can divide, we've found a prime factor.

**3. Moving Up:**
   Once we can't divide by our current number anymore, we move to the next number. We keep doing this until we've factored n completely.

**4. Optimization:**
   We only need to check up to the square root of n. Why? If n has a factor larger than its square root, it must also have a corresponding factor smaller than its square root, which we'll have already found.

**5. Handling Remainders:**
   If after checking up to the square root of n, n is still greater than 1, then n itself is prime. We need to count it as a factor.

**6. Summing Factors:**
   Each time we find a prime factor, we add it to our running total. This sum represents the minimum number of operations needed.

Pseudo-code

```
function minSteps(n):
    if n equals 1:
        return 0  // Base case: we already have one 'A'
    
    total_operations = 0
    factor = 2  // Start with the smallest prime number
    
    while factor * factor <= n:  // Only need to check up to sqrt(n)
        while n is divisible by factor:
            total_operations = total_operations + factor
            n = n divided by factor
        factor = factor + 1
    
    if n > 1:
        total_operations = total_operations + n  // n is prime itself
    
    return total_operations
```

Let's break down this algorithm further:

**1. Base Case:**
   We start by handling the base case. If n is 1, we don't need any operations, so we return 0.

**2. Initialization:**
   We initialize our total_operations to 0 and start with the smallest prime factor, 2.

**3. Main Loop:**
   Our main loop continues while factor * factor <= n. This is our optimization to only check up to the square root of n. Why? Because if n has a factor larger than its square root, it must also have a corresponding factor smaller than its square root (which we'll have already found).

**4. Inner Loop:**
   For each potential factor, we have an inner loop that continues dividing n by this factor as long as possible. This is how we handle repeated prime factors.

**5. Factor Incrementing:**
   If we can't divide by the current factor anymore, we increment it to check the next potential prime factor.

**6. Handling Large Primes:**
   After our main loop, if n is still greater than 1, it means n itself is a prime factor. We add it to our total_operations.

**7. Result:**
   The sum of all these prime factors, stored in total_operations, is our final result.

Each prime factor we find represents a block in our optimal sequence of Copy and Paste operations. The value of the prime factor itself tells us how many operations that block consists of (one Copy followed by factor-1 Pastes).

By focusing on prime factorization, we're directly computing the optimal sequence of operations without having to explicitly consider all the possible ways we could copy and paste. This is the power of the mathematical insight we've gained

### Complexity

**Time complexity: $O(√n)$**

- In the worst case, we might have to check all numbers up to √n as potential factors. This happens when n is prime.
- For each potential factor, we might divide n by it at most log n times.
- So our total operations are bounded by √n * log n, which simplifies to O(√n) because log n grows much slower than √n.

**Space complexity: $O(1)$**

- We're using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
- We only need a few variables (total_operations, factor, and n) that we update as we go.
- This constant space usage gives us O(1) space complexity.
