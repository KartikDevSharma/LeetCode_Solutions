    "## Approach 1: BFS + DFS\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "The problem requires finding the shortest path between two given ```node```s using step-by-step directions. Shortest path problems are common in graph theory, and several efficient algorithms can be learned to solve them. Let's explore solving the problem with one of these algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply one of these algorithms, we first must convert the tree to a bidirectional graph. In a binary tree, each ```node``` can connect to its children but not directly to its parent. To facilitate all the movement from a ```node``` to its parent, we commonly use a parent table. This table stores the parent of each ```node```, built by traversing the tree and marking each ```node```'s children with their respective parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the ability to traverse the tree in any direction, we first locate the starting ```node```. Once we've identified it, we can then proceed to calculate the shortest path.\n",
    "\n",
    "To efficiently determine the shortest path, we use a breadth-first search (BFS) to explore ```node```s at the current depth before moving deeper. For those unfamiliar with BFS, the LeetCode Explore Card provides a helpful introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the BFS traversal, we use a map ``````pathTracker`````` to record the path taken to each ```node```. In ``````pathTracker``````, each key represents a ```node```, while its corresponding value is a pair containing the parent ```node``` and the direction from that parent. Upon reaching the destination ```node```, we backtrack using ``````pathTracker`````` to trace the path back to the start ```node```. The path string is constructed by appending directions from ``````pathTracker`````` and moving to the parent ```node``` stored in the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process continues until we reach the start ```node```. Since directions are recorded in reverse order during backtracking, we reverse the path string to obtain the correct sequence of directions from the start ```node``` to the destination ```node```. Finally, we return this reversed string as the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "Main method ```getDirections```:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialize a map   ```parentMap``` to store parent ```node```s for each ```node``` in the tree.\n",
    "- Find the ```start```Node`````` using the findStart```Node``` method, which recursively searches the tree for the ```node``` with startValue.\n",
    "- Populate parentMap using the populateParentMap method, which traverses the tree and maps each child ```node``` to its parent.\n",
    "- For the BFS, initialize\n",
    "    - A queue containing the start```Node```.\n",
    "    - A set visited```Node```s to keep track of visited ```node```s to avoid cycles.\n",
    "    - A map ```pathTracker``` to record the path taken by the BFS.\n",
    "- While the queue is not empty:\n",
    "    - Dequeue a Tree```Node``` from the queue.\n",
    "    - If the current ```node```'s value matches destValue, we have found our path. Call backtrackPath and return the path calculated by it.\n",
    "- If parentMap contains a parent for the current ```node``` and it hasn't been visited, enqueue the parent ```node``` and add an entry to ```pathTracker``` with the current ```node``` as the key and a pair containing the parent ```node``` and direction 'U' as the value.\n",
    "- If the left child exists and hasn't been visited, enqueue the left child and add an entry to ``````pathTracker`````` with the current ```node``` as the key and a pair containing the left child and direction 'L' as the value.\n",
    "- If the right child exists and hasn't been visited, enqueue the right child and add an entry to ``````pathTracker`````` with the current ```node``` as the key and a pair containing the right child and direction 'R' as the value.\n",
    "- If the destination ```node``` is never reached, an empty string is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helper method ```backtrackPath```:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define backtrackPath with parameters: destination ```node``` (Tree```Node```) and ```pathTracker``` map.\n",
    "- Initialize an empty string path.\n",
    "- While ```node``` exists in ```pathTracker```:\n",
    "    - Retrieve the parent ```node``` and direction from ```pathTracker```.\n",
    "    - Append the direction to path.\n",
    "    - Set ```node``` to the parent ```node```.\n",
    "- Reverse and return path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helper method ```populateParentMap```:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define ```populateParentMap``` with parameters: current ``````node`````` (Tree```Node```) and parentMap.\n",
    "- If ```node``` is null, return.\n",
    "- If left or right children exist, add them to parentMap with ```node``` as their parent.\n",
    "- Recurse on left and right children.\n",
    "Helper method findStart```Node```:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define ```findStart```Node`````` with parameters: current ```node``` (Tree```Node```) and startValue.\n",
    "- If ```node``` is null, return.\n",
    "- If ```node```'s value matches ```startValue```, return ``````node``````.\n",
    "- Recursively search the left subtree. If a ```node``` is found, return it.\n",
    "- Otherwise, search the right subtree and return the result."

    "If we trace paths from the root to the two nodes, we see that these paths share a common segment until a certain point, after which they diverge. This last intersection is the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA). Since it is the last shared point, any ```path``` connecting the two nodes must pass through this LCA. We won't discuss the methods to find the LCA in a binary tree in this article, as it is a separate and popular problem. Here we will be focusing on the application of it. If you are unfamiliar with LCA, check out Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree.\n",

Upon finding the target ```node```, we return immediately. If not found, we backtrack by replacing 'L' with 'R' to explore the right subtree. If the target ```node``` isn't found in either subtree, we backtrack to the parent ```node```. This recursive process continues until the target ```node``` is located.\n",
