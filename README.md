# LeetCode_Solutions.
Welcome to My LeetCode Solutions in Python!
This repository serves as a central hub for my journey on LeetCode, housing my solutions to various coding challenges in Python. It encompasses both regular LeetCode problems and solutions from past contests.
Goals and Approach:
* **Sharpening Algorithmic Skills:** I strive to continuously refine my problem-solving abilities using LeetCode's diverse set of challenges. Each solution prioritizes clarity, efficiency, and a solid grasp of the underlying concepts.
* **Efficiency and Readability:** I believe in crafting solutions that are not only time and space-efficient but also maintain exceptional readability. This balance ensures maintainability, comprehension for others, and potential adaptability to different scenarios.
* **Contest Participation:** To push my limits and explore new approaches, I actively participate in LeetCode contests. Solutions from these contests will be incorporated here, offering a glimpse into my contest problem-solving strategies.
Structure and Organization:
* **LeetCode Problems:** Solutions to regular LeetCode problems will be categorized by difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) for easy navigation.
* **Contest Solutions:** Solutions from LeetCode contests will be stored in a separate directory named `contest_solutions` for clear distinction. Each subdirectory within `contest_solutions` will be named after the specific contest (e.g., `biweekly-contest-79`).
* **File Naming Convention:** Solution files will adhere to a consistent naming pattern using the LeetCode problem number and title separated by a hyphen (e.g., `001-Two-Sum.py`).
## Contribution Guidelines (Optional):
Feel free to contribute your own Python solutions to this repository if you share the same goals! To maintain consistency, please follow the specified structure and naming convention for your contributions. Consider including a brief explanation within your code to enhance its clarity and value to others.
Learning and Improvement:
This repository reflects my ongoing endeavor to learn and grow as a programmer. I am always open to feedback and suggestions. Feel free to create pull requests with improvements or additional solutions!
## Disclaimer:
While I strive for accuracy in my solutions, some problems may have multiple optimal solutions. The solutions provided here represent my approach and may not be the absolute best.

I hope this repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone honing their programming skills with LeetCode. By sharing code and insights, we can collectively learn from each other and ace those coding challenges!
