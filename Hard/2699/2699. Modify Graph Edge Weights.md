### Intuition
So we have an undirected weighted graph which have n nodes where some edges have positive weights and others have a weight of -1. Our job is to change the -1 weight edges by giving them the positive integer values, we need to make the shortest path between two specific nodes (source and destination) equal to the given target distance. At first, you may think that this problem is a variation of the shortest path problem, but we're not just finding the shortest path  we're actually manipulating the graph to get a specific shortest path length. You might think to use Dijkstra's algorithm However just think for a min, because of the presence of -1 weights and the need to modify them. We can't simply run Dijkstra's algorithm for once and be done with it. We need to find a way to assign weights to the -1 edges to meet our target distance.

Now lets take a look at the constraints  We can only modify edges with -1 weights, and we must assign them positive integer values between 1 and $2 * 10^9$. This gives us a wide range to work with, but it also means we need to be careful not to overflow our integer values. 

lets take an example and try to Imagine that you're a city planner and your job is  redesigning a road network. You have a map of existing roads (edges) connecting various locations (nodes). Some of the roads have fixed lengths while others are still in there planning phase (represented by -1 weights). Your job is to find out  the lengths of these planned roads so that the shortest route between two specific locations matches a target distance. now we can't alter the existing roads, but we have the freedom to set the lengths of the planned ones. This constraint adds a layer of complexity which makes it different from standard shortest path problems.
I was also thinking of the basic Dijkstra's algorithm. It's the first solution that comes to mind for finding shortest paths in weighted graphs I considered a naive approach to try all possible combinations of weights for the -1 edges But this wasnt practical I mean it would have worked but with potentially many -1 edges and a large range of possible weights, the number of combinations would be vary large So instead of trying all possibilities what if we could iteratively adjust the weights based on the current shortest path, we might need to run Dijkstra's algorithm multiple times. Because each time we modify an edge weight, it could potentially change the shortest path in the graph. By running it first with only the fixed-weight edges, we could get a baseline shortest path this info would then guide us in assigning weights to the -1 edges in a second pass, try to think about a two-phase approach:

First, we run Dijkstra's algorithm with all -1 weights which are set to 1 (the minimum possible weight). This will gives us the shortest possible path in the graph and If this shortest path is already longer than our target distance, we know it's impossible to solve the problem, and we will simply return an empty array  If the shortest path is shorter than our target, we need to increase some of the -1 weights. But how do we know which ones to increase and by how much for that we can run Dijkstra's algorithm again, but this time, whenever we encounter a -1 edge, we can try to increase its weight just enough to make the path to that node equal to the target distance minus the remaining distance to the destination.

But what if increasing one edge makes another path shorter for that we need to be careful to always maintain the invariant that no path becomes shorter than our target distance. Use two distance arrays where one is for the minimum possible distances (with all -1 weights set to 1) and another is for the distances as we're modifying the weights. By comparing these two arrays  we can make sure that we're always increasing the total path length and never decreasing it.

The use of a priority queue in Dijkstra's algorithm is also helpful although we require additional memory for the priority queue but still It would allow us to always process the node with the shortest current distance while making our weight assignments more efficient. I was thinking if one would need to keep track of not just the nodes, but also the edges so We can use an adjacency list representation of the graph, where each entry in the list contains both the neighboring node and the index of the edge in the original edge list, now think how to handle cases where multiple modifications could lead to the target distance. The problem statement allows for any valid solution, which gives us some flexibility. We can simply stop once we've found a valid configuration, rather than trying to enumerate all possible solutions.


 What if the initial shortest path is already too long  we address this by immediately returning an empty array, saying that no solution is possible.
 How do we make sure that we don't assign weights greater than the allowed maximum (2 * 10^9) we can do this By starting with minimum weights (1) and only increasing them as necessary, we minimize this risk. In practice, it's highly unlikely we'd ever approach the maximum allowed weight.
What if multiple solutions exist, Our approach will find one valid solution, which is sufficient according to the problem statement. However, note that there could be many ways to assign weights that satisfy the target distance. And to handle disconnected graphs The problem statement guarantees a connected graph

Mathematical Insights:

The core mathematical insight here is the relationship between edge weights and path lengths, try to understand that the total path length is simply the sum of its edge weights, we can treat our problem as a type of equation:

(Sum of fixed-weight edges) + (Sum of adjustable-weight edges) = Target Distance

so we're essentially solving for the "Sum of adjustable-weight edges" term.

# Approach

#### 1. Problem Statement

We are given an undirected graph G = (V, E) with n nodes and m edges. Each edge e âˆˆ E has a weight w(e) which is either a positive integer or -1. We are also given a source node s, a destination node t, and a target distance T. Our task is to modify the weights of edges with w(e) = -1 to positive integers such that the shortest path from s to t has a length exactly equal to T, or determine that no such modification is possible.

#### 2. High-Level Approach

Our solution uses a two-phase approach based on Dijkstra's algorithm:

1. Run Dijkstra's algorithm with all -1 weights set to 1 to find the minimum possible shortest path.
2. Run a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm to adjust -1 weights to achieve the target distance T.


### 3.1 First Phase: Initial Dijkstra's Algorithm

In this phase, we run Dijkstra's algorithm on the graph with all -1 weights set to 1. This gives us the shortest possible path from s to t.

```pseudo
function initialDijkstra(G, s, t):
    for each vertex v in G:
        distance[v] = INFINITY
        predecessor[v] = NULL
    
    distance[s] = 0
    Q = priority_queue()
    Q.insert(s, 0)
    
    while Q is not empty:
        u = Q.extract_min()
        for each neighbor v of u:
            if weight(u, v) == -1:
                weight = 1
            else:
                weight = weight(u, v)
            
            if distance[v] > distance[u] + weight:
                distance[v] = distance[u] + weight
                predecessor[v] = u
                Q.insert(v, distance[v])
    
    return distance, predecessor
```

This function returns two arrays:
- `distance`: Contains the shortest distance from s to each node
- `predecessor`: Contains the predecessor of each node in the shortest path

#### 3.2 Feasibility Check

After the initial Dijkstra's run, we check if it's possible to achieve the target distance T:

```pseudo
if distance[t] > T:
    return "No solution possible"
```

If the shortest possible path (with all -1 weights set to 1) is already longer than T, it's impossible to achieve T by increasing weights.

#### 3.3 Second Phase: Modified Dijkstra's Algorithm

If the initial check passes, we run a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm to adjust the -1 weights:

```pseudo
function modifiedDijkstra(G, s, t, T, initialDistance):
    for each vertex v in G:
        distance[v] = INFINITY
        predecessor[v] = NULL
    
    distance[s] = 0
    Q = priority_queue()
    Q.insert(s, 0)
    
    while Q is not empty:
        u = Q.extract_min()
        for each neighbor v of u:
            if weight(u, v) == -1:
                weight = max(1, T + initialDistance[u] - distance[v] - (initialDistance[t] - initialDistance[u]))
                setWeight(u, v, weight)
            else:
                weight = weight(u, v)
            
            if distance[v] > distance[u] + weight:
                distance[v] = distance[u] + weight
                predecessor[v] = u
                Q.insert(v, distance[v])
    
    return distance, predecessor
```

The key difference in this modified version is how we handle -1 weights. Instead of setting them to 1, we calculate a new weight that helps us achieve the target distance T.

#### 3.4 Weight Calculation

The weight calculation is the core of our algorithm:

```pseudo
weight = max(1, T + initialDistance[u] - distance[v] - (initialDistance[t] - initialDistance[u]))
```

Let's break down this formula:

- `T`: Our target distance
- `initialDistance[u]`: The shortest distance from s to u in the initial Dijkstra's run
- `distance[v]`: The current shortest distance from s to v in this modified run
- `initialDistance[t]`: The shortest distance from s to t in the initial run

This formula ensures that:
1. We never set a weight less than 1
2. We increase the weight just enough to make the path through this edge potentially achieve the target distance T

#### 3.5 Final Check

After the modified Dijkstra's run, we perform a final check:

```pseudo
if distance[t] != T:
    return "No solution possible"
else:
    return modifiedGraph
```

If we couldn't achieve exactly T, we return that no solution is possible. Otherwise, we return the modified graph.



#### 4.1 Correctness

The correctness of our algorithm relies on two key invariants:

1. For any vertex v, the distance to v in the modified run is always greater than or equal to the distance in the initial run.
2. The shortest path from s to t in the modified graph is always at least T.

These invariants ensure that we're always increasing path lengths and never decreasing them below T.

Our algorithm is optimal in the sense that it never increases edge weights more than necessary. It processes vertices in order of increasing distance, ensuring that we only increase weights when absolutely needed to achieve T.


The algorithm is guaranteed to terminate because:
1. Dijkstra's algorithm processes each vertex exactly once
2. The number of vertices is finite
3. Edge weights are increased monotonically



#### 7. Handling Edge Cases


If s = t, we simply need to check if T = 0. If so, we return the original graph. If not, no solution is possible. 
If there are no -1 weight edges, our algorithm degenerates to standard Dijkstra's algorithm. We just need to check if the shortest path equals T. 
If the graph is disconnected and t is not reachable from s, our initial Dijkstra's run will set distance[t] to INFINITY, and we'll correctly report that no solution is possible.



# Complexity
* **Time complexity:** The time complexity of this solution is $O((E + V) log V)$, where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices $(nodes)$ in the graph. This is because we run Dijkstra's algorithm twice, and each run of Dijkstra's algorithm using a priority queue has a time complexity of $O((E + V) log V)$. The additional operations (creating the adjacency list, initializing distances, and updating edges) are all linear in terms of E or V, so they don't affect the overall time complexity.

* **Space complexity**: The space complexity is $O(E + V)$. This comes from:
  - The adjacency list, which stores all edges and thus takes O(E) space.
  - The distances array, which stores two distances for each vertex, taking O(V) space.
  - The priority queue used in Dijkstra's algorithm, which in the worst case could contain all vertices, taking O(V) space.
  - The original edges array, which takes O(E) space.

Therefore, the total space complexity is $O(E + V)$.

### Example

![example 1.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/101d5c08-6748-4d17-aa01-16b594877b99_1724833011.0585895.png)  
Lets take the example 1 from problem  
## Initial Setup

- The example involves a graph with 5 nodes (0 to 4) and edges represented as `[[4,1,-1],[2,0,-1],[0,3,-1],[4,3,-1]]`.

- The source node is 0, the destination node is 1, and the target distance is 5.

- Edges with weight -1 can be modified to positive integer values. 
## Step 1: Build the Graph

- An empty graph is initially created.

- No edges are added at this stage because all weights are -1.

- The graph remains empty, represented by adjacency lists for each node.  
## Step 2: Compute Initial Shortest Distance

- Dijkstra's algorithm is run on the empty graph.

- Since there are no edges, no paths are found.

- The shortest distance is set to INF (infinity).

- This initial distance (INF) is not less than the target (5), so the algorithm continues. 
## Step 3: Adjust Edge Weights

The algorithm processes each edge and adjusts its weight:
1. Edge [4,1,-1]:

- Weight is set to 1.

- Graph updated: node 4 now connects to node 1 with weight 1.
2. Edge [2,0,-1]:

- Weight is set to 1.

- Graph updated: node 2 now connects to node 0 with weight 1.
3. Edge [0,3,-1]:

- Weight is set to 1.

- Graph updated: node 0 now connects to node 3 with weight 1.

4. Edge [4,3,-1]:

- Weight is set to 1.

- Graph updated: node 4 now connects to node 3 with weight 1.
  
After these adjustments, the graph has all edges with weight 1.

## Final Adjustment

- The current shortest path from source (0) to destination (1) has a distance of 3.

- This is less than the target distance of 5, so further adjustment is needed.

- The algorithm identifies that the weight of edge [0,3] needs to be increased.

- It sets the weight of edge [0,3] to 3 (instead of 1).

- This results in a path 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 with a total distance of 5, meeting the target.
 
## Final Graph

The final graph has the following structure:

- Edge [4,1] with weight 1

- Edge [2,0] with weight 1

- Edge [0,3] with weight 3 (adjusted)

- Edge [4,3] with weight 1

This configuration achieves the target shortest path distance of 5 from node 0 to node 1.
####  Example 2

**Initial Setup**
* The example has a graph with 3 nodes (0 to 2) and edges represented as `[[0,1,-1],[0,2,5]]`.
* The source node is 0, the destination node is 2, and the target distance is 6.
* One edge (from 0 to 1) has weight -1 and can be modified to a positive integer value.

**Step 1: Build the Graph**
* An initial graph is created with the fixed-weight edge:
  - Edge from 0 to 2 with weight 5
* The -1 weight edge (0 to 1) is not added at this stage.

**Step 2: Compute Initial Shortest Distance**
* Dijkstra's algorithm is run on the initial graph.
* The shortest path from 0 to 2 is the direct edge with weight 5.
* This initial distance (5) is less than the target (6), so the algorithm continues.

**Step 3: Adjust Edge Weights**
The algorithm processes each edge:
1. Edge [0,1,-1]:
   * This edge is not on the current shortest path to the destination.
   * Modifying this edge won't affect the shortest path from 0 to 2.
   * The algorithm can't use this edge to increase the path length to 6.
2. Edge [0,2,5]:
   * This edge has a fixed weight and cannot be modified.

**Final Check**
* The shortest path from source (0) to destination (2) has a distance of 5.
* This is less than the target distance of 6.
* There are no modifiable edges on the path that can be adjusted to reach the target.

**Conclusion**
* It's impossible to achieve the target distance of 6 from node 0 to node 2.
* The algorithm correctly returns an empty array, indicating no solution exists.

It's impossible because The only direct path from 0 to 2 has a fixed weight of 5. The only modifiable edge (0 to 1) is not on any path to node 2. Even if we set the weight of edge [0,1] to any positive value, it won't affect the shortest path to node 2. There's no way to increase the path length from 5 to 6 given these constraints.

#### Example 3

**Initial Setup**
* The example has a graph with 4 nodes (0 to 3) and edges represented as `[[1,0,4],[1,2,3],[2,3,5],[0,3,-1]]`.
* The source node is 0, the destination node is 2, and the target distance is 6.
* One edge (from 0 to 3) has weight -1 and can be modified to a positive integer value.

**Step 1: Build the Graph**
* An initial graph is created with the fixed-weight edges:
  - Edge from 1 to 0 with weight 4
  - Edge from 1 to 2 with weight 3
  - Edge from 2 to 3 with weight 5
* The -1 weight edge (0 to 3) is not added at this stage.

**Step 2: Compute Initial Shortest Distance**
* Dijkstra's algorithm is run on the initial graph.
* The shortest path from 0 to 2 is 0 -> 1 -> 2 with a total weight of 7 (4 + 3).
* This initial distance (7) is greater than the target (6), so the algorithm continues.

**Step 3: Adjust Edge Weights**
The algorithm processes each edge:
1. Edges [1,0,4], [1,2,3], and [2,3,5]:
   * These edges have fixed weights and cannot be modified.
2. Edge [0,3,-1]:
   * This edge can be modified to create a potentially shorter path.
   * The algorithm calculates the optimal weight for this edge:
     - Current shortest path: 0 -> 1 -> 2 (distance 7)
     - Potential new path: 0 -> 3 -> 2
     - To achieve target distance 6: weight([0,3]) + weight([2,3]) = 6
     - Therefore, weight([0,3]) = 6 - 5 = 1

**Final Adjustment**
* The weight of edge [0,3] is set to 1.
* This creates a new shortest path: 0 -> 3 -> 2 with a total distance of 6 (1 + 5).

**Final Check**
* The new shortest path from source (0) to destination (2) has a distance of 6.
* This matches the target distance of 6.

**Final Graph**
The final graph has the following structure:
* Edge [1,0] with weight 4 (unchanged)
* Edge [1,2] with weight 3 (unchanged)
* Edge [2,3] with weight 5 (unchanged)
* Edge [0,3] with weight 1 (adjusted from -1)

**Conclusion**
* The algorithm successfully modifies the graph to achieve the target shortest path distance of 6 from node 0 to node 2.
* It returns the modified edge list: `[[1,0,4],[1,2,3],[2,3,5],[0,3,1]]`.

It works because The initial shortest path was longer than the target, allowing room for optimization. Modifying the [0,3] edge created a new, shorter path that exactly matches the target distance. The algorithm correctly identified the optimal weight for the modifiable edge to achieve the desired result.

### Mathematical Justification
#### **1. Problem Definition and Notation**
**Given:**

- A graph $G = (V, E)$ where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges.

- Each edge $e \in E$ has a weight $w(e)$ âˆˆ â„• âˆª {-1}, where -1 indicates that the weight is adjustable.

- A source vertex $s \in V$.

- A destination vertex $t \in V$.

- A target distance $T \in â„•$.

**Objective:** Modify the weights of edges with $w(e) = -1$ to positive integers such that the shortest path from $s$ to $t$ has length exactly $T$, or determine that no such modification is possible.  

#### **2. Algorithm Overview**
The algorithm is divided into two main phases:
1.  **Initial Dijkstra Run:**

- Assume all adjustable (-1) edge weights are set to 1.

- Compute the shortest path from $s$ to $t$ under this assumption.

2.  **Feasibility Check and Weight Adjustment:**

- If the shortest path found in the first phase is greater than $T$, terminate, as no solution is possible.

- Otherwise, adjust the weights of -1 edges to achieve the exact path length $T$.


```plaintext

Algorithm ModifyEdgeWeights(G, s, t, T):

1. Initialize d1(v) = âˆž for all v in V

2. Set d1(s) = 0

3. For each edge e âˆˆ E where w(e) = -1, set w(e) = 1

4. Run Dijkstra's algorithm from s to all v in V using weights w(e) and store the shortest distances in d1(v)

5. If d1(t) > T:

Return "No solution"

6. Initialize d2(v) = âˆž for all v in V

7. Set d2(s) = 0

8. Run modified Dijkstra's algorithm from s to t:

For each vertex u processed:

For each adjacent vertex v:

If w(v, u) = -1:

Set w(v, u) = max(1, T + d1(u) - d2(v) - (d1(t) - d1(u)))

Update d2(v) = min(d2(v), d2(u) + w(v, u))

9. If d2(t) = T:

Return "Solution found" with modified weights

10. Else:

Return "No solution"

```
#### **3. Definitions and Notations**
- $d_1(v)$: Shortest distance from $s$ to $v$ after the first Dijkstra run.
- $d_2(v)$: Shortest distance from $s$ to $v$ after the second Dijkstra run (with adjusted weights).
- $w_1(e)$: Weight of edge $e$ during the first Dijkstra run.
- $w_2(e)$: Weight of edge $e$ during the second Dijkstra run.
#### **4. Invariants**
-  **Invariant 1 (I1):** $d_1(v) \leq d_2(v)$ for all vertices $v \in V$. This ensures that the path lengths do not decrease during the second phase.

-  **Invariant 2 (I2):** The shortest path from $s$ to $t$ in the modified graph is at least $T$.
#### **5. Lemmas**
>**Lemma 1:** For all edges $e \in E$, $w_1(e) \leq w_2(e)$.
**Proof:** In the first phase, $w_1(e) = 1$ for all edges with initial weight -1. In the second phase, these weights are either kept at 1 or increased. Fixed-weight edges remain unchanged, i.e., $w_1(e) = w_2(e)$. Hence, $w_1(e) \leq w_2(e)$ for all edges.
**Lemma 2:** If $d_1(t) > T$, no solution exists.
**Proof:** $d_1(t)$ represents the shortest possible path length when all adjustable edges are assigned their minimum possible weight (1). Any increase in these weights would only increase the path length further, making $T$ unattainable. Therefore, if $d_1(t) > T$, the problem is unsolvable.
#### **6. Base Case**
**After the First Dijkstra Run:**
>-  **Invariant 1 (I1):** Trivially holds as $d_2(v)$ is not yet defined.

>-  **Invariant 2 (I2):** If $d_1(t) \leq T$, the algorithm proceeds; otherwise, it terminates based on Lemma 2.  
#### **7. Inductive Step**
**Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume Invariants I1 and I2 hold after processing $k$ vertices during the second Dijkstra run.

**Let $u$ be the $(k+1)^{th}$ vertex processed, and $(v, u)$ be an edge where $v$ has been processed.**

**Case 1:** $w(v, u) > 0$ (known positive weight).
-  **Update:** $d_2(u) = \min(d_2(u), d_2(v) + w(v, u))$.
-  **Invariant 1:** Since $d_2(v) \geq d_1(v)$ (by the inductive hypothesis) and $w(v, u) \geq w_1(v, u)$, it follows that $d_2(u) \geq d_1(u)$, by the inductive hypothesis and the fact that the shortest path found in the second run cannot be shorter than the first run, where all adjustable weights were set to 1.
-  **Invariant 2:** The length of any path through $u$ remains at least $T$ by the inductive hypothesis. The shortest path from $s$ to $t$ in the modified graph is at least $T$. 
**Case 2:** $w(v, u) = -1$ (adjustable weight).
-  **Adjustment:** Set $w_2(v, u) = \max(1, T + d_1(u) - d_2(v) - (d_1(t) - d_1(u)))$. 
**Subcase 2a:** $w_2(v, u) = 1$.

- Similar reasoning as in Case 1 ensures both invariants hold.

**Subcase 2b:** $w_2(v, u) > 1$.

-  **Update:** $d_2(u) = d_2(v) + w_2(v, u) = T - (d_1(t) - d_1(u))$.

-  **Invariant 1:** $d_2(u) = T - (d_1(t) - d_1(u)) \geq d_1(u)$ since $d_1(t) \leq T$.

-  **Invariant 2:** The shortest path remains at least $T$.

- The shortest path from $s$ to $u$ via $v$ is increased or adjusted to maintain the target distance $T$ while respecting $d1(t) \leq T$.

- This formula is derived to keep the modified path lengths consistent with the goal of achieving $T$ for the path from $s$ to $t$.

**Conclusion:** By induction, I1 and I2 hold throughout the second Dijkstra run. This ensures that $d2(u) \geq d1(u)$, satisfying **Invariant I1**, and the adjusted weight doesnâ€™t decrease the path length below $T$, satisfying **Invariant I2**.
#### **8. Termination**
The algorithm terminates because:

1. Dijkstra's algorithm processes each vertex exactly once.

2. The number of vertices $V$ is finite.

3. The weights of edges are increased monotonically, ensuring progress towards achieving the target path length $T$.
#### **9. Correctness of the Final Solution**
**If a Solution is Found:**

1. $d_2(t) = T$ (by I2 and the algorithm's design).

2. All modified edge weights are positive integers.

3. The exact path length $T$ is achieved without violating any constraints.

**If No Solution is Found:**
1. Either $d_1(t) > T$ (proven impossible by Lemma 2).

2. Or $d_2(t) < T$ after the second run, indicating that $T$ cannot be achieved by any further increase in edge weights.
#### **10. Optimality**
The algorithm is optimal in the sense that it never increases edge weights more than necessary:

1. It processes vertices in increasing order of distance.

2. It only increases weights to the minimum required to achieve the path length $T$. 
#### **11. Handling Multiple Solutions**
If multiple solutions exist, the algorithm finds one valid solution:

1. It prioritizes modifying edges closer to the source.

2. Among equidistant edges, it modifies them in the order they are processed.

3. Any valid solution satisfies the problem constraints.
#### **12. Edge Cases**
**a. $s = t$:** The algorithm correctly handles this by setting $d_1(s) = d_2(s) = 0$.
**b. No -1 weight edges:** The algorithm degenerates to standard Dijkstra's algorithm.

**c. Disconnected graph:** The algorithm would correctly report no solution, as $d_1(t)$ would be infinite.
#### **13. Time Complexity**
The algorithm runs in $O((E + V) \log V)$ time:

1. Two runs of Dijkstra's algorithm: $O((E + V) \log V)$ each.

2. Edge weight adjustments: $O(E)$ total.

3. The correctness proof doesn't impact the time complexity.
4. 
#### 14. **Space Complexity** 
The space complexity is $O(V + E)$, as the algorithm primarily uses arrays to store distances $d1(v)$, $d2(v)$, and the graph itself, requiring linear space relative to the number of vertices and edges.
  

#### **15. No False Negatives**
The algorithm never incorrectly reports that no solution exists when one does:

1. If $d_1(t) > T$, no solution exists (Lemma 2).

2. If $d_2(t) < T$ after the second run, increasing any edge weight further would only increase $d_2(t)$, making $T$ unattainable.

3. The algorithm explores all possible paths by the nature of Dijkstra's algorithm.
 

This proof shows that the algorithm correctly modifies edge weights to achieve the target distance $T$ when possible and determines when no such modification is feasible.
