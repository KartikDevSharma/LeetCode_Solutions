## 1. Problem Statement in Simple Terms

You are given a string `s` (composed only of the digits `'0'` to `'4'`) and an integer `k`. You need to pick a substring of `s` (a contiguous part of `s`) that has **at least** `k` characters. In that substring, you must choose **two different characters**, let's call them `a` and `b`, such that:

- **Frequency of `a` is odd.**
- **Frequency of `b` is even (and, importantly, `b` must appear at least once, because 0 is even but would mean `b` doesn't appear).**

Your goal is to maximize the difference:  

$\text{difference} = \text{freq}[a] - \text{freq}[b]$

over all valid substrings and choices of characters.

*For example*, for `s = "1122211"` and `k = 3`, one valid substring is `"11222"` where:
- Frequency of `'2'` (say, our `a`) is 3 (which is odd),  
- Frequency of `'1'` (say, our `b`) is 2 (which is even).  
So, the difference is `3 - 2 = 1`.

---

## 2. Why a Brute–Force Approach Is Not Feasible

A straightforward way to solve the problem would be:
- **Enumerate every substring** of length at least `k`.
- For each substring, **count the frequencies** of every digit.
- Then, try all pairs of distinct characters (there are at most 5 digits, so 20 pairs) to see if one has an odd frequency and the other an even frequency.
- Compute the difference and track the maximum.

However, the string length $n$ can be up to 30,000. The number of substrings is roughly on the order of $O(n^2)$, and checking each substring is too slow for $n = 30,000$. We need an approach that runs much faster than $O(n^2)$.

## 3. The Key Ideas and Mathematical Reformulation

### **A. Using Prefix Sums for Fast Frequency Queries**

**Prefix sums** are a common tool to quickly compute the frequency (or sum) in any substring. For each digit $d$ (from `'0'` to `'4'`), we build an array `pref[d]` such that:

$\mathtt{pref}[d][i] = \text{number of times } d \text{ appears in } s[0:i]$

Then, for any substring $s[i:j]$, the frequency of digit $d$ in that substring is:

$\text{freq}_d(s[i:j]) = \mathtt{pref}[d][j] - \mathtt{pref}[d][i]$

This lets us answer frequency queries in $O(1)$ time.

---

### **B. Reformulating the Frequency Difference**

For a **fixed pair** of digits $a$ and $b$ (with $a \neq b$), suppose we want to know the difference:

$\text{diff} = \text{freq}_a(s[i:j]) - \text{freq}_b(s[i:j])$

Using the prefix sums, this becomes:

$\text{diff} = \bigl( \mathtt{pref}[a][j] - \mathtt{pref}[a][i] \bigr) - \bigl( \mathtt{pref}[b][j] - \mathtt{pref}[b][i] \bigr)$
$= \Bigl( \mathtt{pref}[a][j] - \mathtt{pref}[b][j] \Bigr) - \Bigl( \mathtt{pref}[a][i] - \mathtt{pref}[b][i] \Bigr)$

Let's define a new function:

$f(x) = \mathtt{pref}[a][x] - \mathtt{pref}[b][x]$

Then the difference for the substring becomes:

$\text{diff} = f(j) - f(i)$

So, **if we can choose two indices** $i$ and $j$ (with $j-i \ge k$) satisfying certain conditions (see next), maximizing $\text{diff}$ is equivalent to finding the best pair $f(j) - f(i)$.

---

### **C. Translating the "Odd" and "Even" Conditions Using Parity**

The substring $s[i:j]$ must satisfy:
- **$a$ appears an odd number of times:**  
  
  $\mathtt{pref}[a][j] - \mathtt{pref}[a][i] \text{ is odd}$
  
  In terms of parity (even/odd), a difference is odd if the parity (0 for even, 1 for odd) of $\mathtt{pref}[a][j]$ and $\mathtt{pref}[a][i]$ are **different**.
  
- **$b$ appears an even number of times (and at least once):**  
  
  $\mathtt{pref}[b][j] - \mathtt{pref}[b][i] \text{ is even, and } \mathtt{pref}[b][j] > \mathtt{pref}[b][i]$
  
  Notice that "even" here includes 0, but 0 is not allowed because it means $b$ didn't appear. Thus we need:
  
  $\mathtt{pref}[b][j] - \mathtt{pref}[b][i] \ge 2 \quad \text{or at least } \ge 1 \text{ if we ignore parity and then check separately}$
  
  For our purpose, it's easier to ensure that $b$ appears by requiring:
  
  $\mathtt{pref}[b][j] > \mathtt{pref}[b][i]$
  
To help with these checks, we precompute:
- $p_a[x] = \mathtt{pref}[a][x] \mod 2$  
- $p_b[x] = \mathtt{pref}[b][x] \mod 2$  
- $cnt_b[x] = \mathtt{pref}[b][x]$

Now, the condition for $a$ in the substring $s[i:j]$ becomes:

$p_a[j] \neq p_a[i]$

And for $b$ we require:

$cnt_b[j] > cnt_b[i]$

(ensuring that $b$ occurs at least once in the substring).

---

### **D. Reformulating the Problem as a "Best Subarray Difference"**

With the definitions above, for each fixed pair $(a,b)$ we want to maximize:

$f(j) - f(i)$

subject to:
- $j - i \ge k$ (substring length condition),
- $p_a[j] \neq p_a[i]$ (ensuring odd frequency of $a$),
- $cnt_b[j] > cnt_b[i]$ (ensuring $b$ appears at least once).

Notice that for any fixed ending index $j$ (representing the end of a substring), the above conditions tell us which starting indices $i$ (with $i \le j-k$) are valid.  
So, **if we can quickly find, for each $j$, the minimum value of $f(i)$ among those valid $i$'s,** then $f(j) - f(i)$ is maximized by choosing the smallest possible $f(i)$.

---

## 4. The Final Approach and Code Explanation

### **A. Iterating Over Each Pair $(a, b)$**

Since the digits are only `'0'` to `'4'`, there are at most 5 choices for $a$ and 4 remaining choices for $b$ (because $a \neq b$). This gives at most 20 pairs. For each such pair, we do the following steps.

### **B. Precomputing the Needed Arrays**

For the fixed pair $(a,b)$, we build arrays of length $n+1$ (where $n$ is the length of `s`):
- **$f[i] = \mathtt{pref}[a][i] - \mathtt{pref}[b][i]$**
- **$p_a[i] = \mathtt{pref}[a][i] \mod 2$**
- **$p_b[i] = \mathtt{pref}[b][i] \mod 2$**
- **$cnt_b[i] = \mathtt{pref}[b][i]$**

These arrays let us quickly answer, for any substring $s[i:j]$, what the difference $f(j)-f(i)$ is and whether the odd/even conditions are met.

### **C. Maintaining a Data Structure for Candidate Starting Indices**

As we slide the ending index $j$ from $k$ to $n$:
- We can add candidate starting indices $i$ (from 0 up to $j-k$) into "buckets" grouped by the pair $(p_a[i], p_b[i])$.  
- **Why group by parity?**  
  Because for a valid substring ending at $j$ we require:
  
  $(p_a[i], p_b[i]) = \bigl(1 - p_a[j],\; p_b[j]\bigr)$
  
  That is, the starting index $i$ must have the "opposite" parity for $a$ (so that the difference in counts is odd) but the **same** parity for $b$.

- In each bucket, we store pairs: $(cnt_b[i], f[i])$. Since the prefix counts for $b$ never decrease as $i$ increases, these lists are automatically sorted by $cnt_b[i]$.  
- We also maintain a "prefix minimum" for $f[i]$ in each bucket, which means that for any given number of occurrences of $b$, we know the smallest $f[i]$ we've seen so far.

### **D. Using Binary Search to Quickly Find the Best Candidate**

For the current ending index $j$:
1. We need to consider only those candidate indices $i$ with $cnt_b[i] < cnt_b[j]$ (so that $b$ actually appears in the substring $s[i:j]$).
2. Since the candidate list is sorted by $cnt_b[i]$, we use **binary search** to find all indices in the bucket (with key $(1 - p_a[j], p_b[j])$) that satisfy $cnt_b[i] < cnt_b[j]$.
3. The prefix–minimum array (for that bucket) tells us the smallest $f[i]$ among those valid candidates.
4. We then compute:
   
   $\text{diff} = f(j) - (\text{minimum } f[i] \text{ among valid } i)$
   
5. Update our best answer if this $\text{diff}$ is higher.

### **E. Respecting the Substring Length Constraint**

We only add a candidate index $i$ when $i \le j-k$. This ensures that the substring $s[i:j]$ has at least $k$ characters.

### **F. Summary of the Final Code**

## 5. Wrap–Up: Why This Approach Works

-   **Efficiency:**  
    Instead of checking every possible substring (which is $O(n2)O(n^2)$), we precompute prefix sums and then process the string in a single pass for each fixed pair $(a,b)(a,b)$. There are only 20 pairs, and for each pair the inner loop runs in $O(nlog⁡n)O(n \log n)$ due to binary search. This is fast enough given $n≤30 000n \le 30\,000.$
    
-   **Correctness:**  
    By reformulating the frequency difference as $f(j)−f(i)f(j) - f(i)$ and carefully choosing candidate ii’s that satisfy the parity conditions, we ensure that the substring $s[i:j]s[i:j]$ meets the conditions:
    
    -   The frequency of aa is odd.
    -   The frequency of bb is even and bb appears.
    -   The substring length is at least kk.
-   **Generalization:**  
    Although the problem allows substrings to contain more than two distinct characters, our method only “tracks” the counts for the two chosen characters aa and bb. The other characters do not affect the condition or the computed difference.
